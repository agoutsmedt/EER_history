  abstract = {The Rotterdam model is a discrete approximation to a continuous time model and the approximation errors are known to be small. Unlike other approximations, with fixed parameters at the point of approximation, the Rotterdam model's coefficients differ at each observation, but are treated as constants during estimation. This procedure introduces relatively large approximation errors which are a potential source of bias. In this paper the performance of the Rotterdam model in reproducing the characteristics of four integrable demand systems is assessed. As anticipated, the model's performance is directly related to the variability of the underlying coefficients and the bias in the parameter estimates is minimal if the coefficients are relatively constant. The model can also discriminate well against an invalid alternative hypothesis. However, in the absence of a computationally feasible varying parameter methodology the conclusion has to be that tests of parameter stability are essential when using the Rotterdam model.},

Worlds of parameter change are considered and exogeneity is related to structural invariance leading to a definition of super exogeneity.

  abstract = {The system-wide approach to demand analysis emphasises the interrelatedness of all n elements of the consumption basket and leads to a set of demand equations characterised by n income elasticities and an n\texttimes n matrix of own- and cross-price elasticities. This approach is now used on a routine basis in CGE modelling, the measurement of the deadweight loss of distortions in consumption and a number of other areas in applied economics. Half a century ago, Barten (1964) and Theil (1965) formulated the Rotterdam model, now an important member of the system-wide family. A path-breaking innovation, this model allowed for the first time rigorous testing of the theory of the utility-maximising consumer. This has led to a vibrant, on-going strand of research on the theoretical underpinnings of the model, extensions and numerous applications. But perhaps due to its European heritage and unorthodox derivation, there is still misunderstanding and a tendency for the Rotterdam model to be regarded with reservations and/or uncertainties (if not mistrust). This paper marks the golden jubilee of the model by clarifying its foundations, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses, elucidating its links with other models of consumer demand, and dealing with some recent developments that have their roots in Barten and Theil's pioneering research of the 1960s.},

To investigate this mechanism, conventional wage and price equations are estimated for 19 countries and then used for simulation. Stagflation has been caused in roughly equal amounts by rising relative import prices and by the fall in the rate of productivity growth. In the basic model the Phillips curve is assumed not to adapt to falls in feasible real wage growth, but in a final section an adaptive wage equation is estimated, which confirms that the process of adaptation is slow.},

  note = {\section{Introduction}

\par
\guillemotleft{} Twenty years ago the dominant macroeconomic paradigm regarded movements in unemployment as the result of a combination of shocks to aggregate demand and sluggish wage/price adjustment. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 523)
\par
\section{Theoretical Ideas}

\par
\guillemotleft{} As a result of this empirical failure, the past two decades have seen the replacement - or rather augmentation - of the traditional paradigm by one in which movements in the natural, or equilibrium, rate of unemployment play a key role. Many of the ideas are not new, and often represent little more than the application of standard microeconomic thinking to a macroeconomic model in which the labour market had been pushed well into the background. T\textbf{he basic tool of analysis, common to most of what Phelps (1992) has dubbed `structuralist' models of unemployment, is a straightforward elaboration of the standard Classical labour supply/demand apparatus} to accommodate a variety of market imperfections and rigidities \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 524)
\par
\guillemotleft{} This equation can be obtained from either an efficiency wage story, e.g. the ShapiroStiglitz (1984) `no-shirking' condition, or as the outcome of bilateral bargaining over wages when there are unions (Layard et al., 1991) or matching frictions (Pissarides, 1990). \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 525)
\par
\section{Empirical Approaches}

\par
\guillemotleft{} Elaborations of this framework, in varying degrees of complexity, underlie much of the empirical research programme of the last decade or so. In particular a great deal of effort has been expended on the estimation of wage-setting relationships, usually in the guise of \textbf{a conventional Phillips curve plus a Sargan-style error-correction term} in e.g. the lagged labour share, that generates the required relationship between unemployment and the level of real wages \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 526)
\par
\section{Findings}

\par
\guillemotleft{} Under the first heading come such things as the OPEC-induced deterioration in the terms of trade as well as conventional aggregate demand disturbances. Under the second come cross-country differences in response to a given shock, as well as in the slope of (particularly) the wage-setting function, m(.). The third category, although not present in the model of Section 2, has been the object of the bulk of recent research and explores how the effects of shocks are propagated through time through insider-outsider mechanisms and the like. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 528)
\par
\guillemotleft{} In particular the empirical literature tends to point to the conclusion that real wages are relatively unresponsive to the level of unemployment i.e. the wage-setting schedule is rather flat. Following the lead of Bruno and Sachs (1985) a number of authors have focussed on the extent of co-ordination or `corporatism' in wage bargaining, the argument being that in unionised economies co-ordination helps to internalise bargaining externalities,' the most celebrated exposition of this argument being Calmfors and DrifIill (1988). \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 531)
\par
\guillemotleft{} \textbf{Four broad sorts of persistence mechanism} have been identified in the literature, two on the demand side of the market and two on the supply side. On the demand side, \textbf{hiring and firing costs introduce inertia into the firm's employment decision}, the most notable contributions in this vein being Bentolila and Bertola (1990), Bertola (1990) and Lazear (1990). \textbf{A lack of capital} has also been cited as a potential constraint on employment when factor proportions cannot be varied easily; see Sneessens and Dreze (1986) for instance. On the supply side, there is the \textbf{insider-outsider theory of Lindbeck} and Snower (1988) and Blanchard and Summers (1986) which argues that wages are determined primarily by the insiders with little attention paid to the interests of outsiders: temporary shocks that reduce insider membership then have an impact on future wage and employment levels. The final persistence mechanism argues that the \textbf{unemployed progressively become disconnected from the labour market}, either because they become \textbf{less attractive to employers} e.g., Blanchard and Diamond (1993) or because their \textbf{search effectiveness drops}, e.g. Layard and Nickel1 (1987). \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 532)},

\par
\guillemotleft{} the rest of the OECD?' Conventional macroeconomic thinking would suggest that either supply side developments had raised the equilibrium, or "natural," rate of unemployment in the European Community, or that unemployment there was temporarily above its equilibrium rate as a result of a negative demand shock. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 574)
\par
\section{Theoretical backgrounds}

\par
\guillemotleft{} This framework is depicted in Figure 3, drawn in employment/real-wage space, and represents a straightforward generalization of the standard labordemand/labor-supply diagram to allow for noncompetitive features. The downward-sloping line PN (henceforth the "price-employment schedule") corresponds to the usual labor demand schedule and the upward-sloping line WW (henceforth the "wage-setting schedule") corresponds to the usual labor supply schedule. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 576)
\par
\guillemotleft{} An early approach to the study of rising employment-that of the "real wage gap"-focused on the implications of this relationship under perfect competition (m = 0). This approach, pioneered in OECD (1977) and refined by Michael Bruno and Jeffrey Sachs (1985) and Sachs (1979), relies on a comparison of the observed real wage with an estimate of the full employment real wage (usually obtained by trend extrapolation). Given an assumption on o1, equation (1) can then be used to infer the extent to which unemployment is due to "excessive" real wages ("Classical unemployment"), with any additional unemployment attributable to a lack of demand ("Keynesian unemployment \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 577)
\par
\guillemotleft{} While this approach may provide a useful initial cut at the data, it does have important limitations. First, it does not explain why real wages are excessive, which presumably we also want to know. Second, an increase in the real wage resulting from an upward shift in the wagesetting schedule would eventually lead to capital decumulation and thus shift the price-employment schedule downwards. Unless the full employment wage is modeled appropriately, this will give the appearance of Classical unemployment being replaced by Keynesian unemployment although the fundamental cause of the unemployment has not altered. Third, under imperfect competition the real wage is the outcome of the interaction between wage setters, who determine the nominal wage, and firms, who set nominal prices. An increase in the markup, M, would again shift the priceemployment schedule downwards, but it would be associated with a fall in the real wage, apparently signaling Keynesian unemployment although supply side forces are at work. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 577)
\par
\section{The sources of shocks}

\subsection{Demand}

\par
\guillemotleft{} So explaining the different patterns of unemployment across countries through this factor must require different unemployment costs of getting inflation down. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 584)
\par
\guillemotleft{} A standard conclusion is that North America is characterized by a reasonably high degree of nominal wage inertia, but that there is little evidence of nominal inertia (on annual data) in the rest of the OECD. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 584)
\par
\subsection{The productivity slowdown}

\subsection{Import Prices and Taxes}

\subsection{Worker Militancy}

\par
\guillemotleft{} Another explanation focusing on the role of the wage aspirations of workers, but this time on their ability to actually achieve them, is provided by the argument that there was an increase in the use and effectiveness of union power during the seventies. An increase in union power would shift the wage-setting schedule upwards and thus raise equilibrium unemployment. The main problem with evaluating this hypothesis is obtaining a suitable measure of union power. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 590)
\par
\subsection{Unemployment Benefit}

\subsection{Mismatch}

\par
\guillemotleft{} Another explanation for the rise in unemployment that is consistent with the apparent outward shift in the UV curve in the European Community is an increase in mismatch resulting from changes in the structure of demand or technology away from traditional heavy manufacturing industries \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 594)
\par
\subsection{Labor Market Regulations}

\subsection{Price Markups}

\section{The impact of Activity on Prices and Wages}

\par
\guillemotleft{} The bottom line of this is that no single factor stands out as the cause of the rise in European unemployment, although it seems difficult to believe the terms-oftrade shocks of the seventies and the counter-inflationary policies and high interest rates of the eighties do not have some part to play in the story. More particularly it is not immed\&itely obvious why the European CommVnity has suffered particularly badly and also why the rise in unemployment has been so persis- \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 596)
\par
\guillemotleft{} The fact that the latter group of countries have markedly different labor market structures from the European Community and the United States has led a number of authors to focus on institutional differences as a key factor in understanding the heterogeneity of unemployment experience. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 601)
\par
\guillemotleft{} Prominent early works in this vein include Bruno and Sachs (1985) and John McCallum (1983) who explicitly relate macroeconomic performance across the OECD to a measure of corporatism originating in the work of Colin Crouch (1985). \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 601)
\par
\section{The sources of persistence}

\par
\guillemotleft{} We have seen that there are a number of factors which may have contributed to the original upward impulse to unemployment, and that structural differences, rather than differences in the magnitude of the exogenous shocks, explains the heterogeneity in unemployment experience. However, it is difficult to isolate movements in any exogenous factor which could be plausibly held responsible for a more or less permanent increase in equilibrium unemployment. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 603)
\par
\guillemotleft{} Phelps (1972) contains a discussion of two mechanisms that could lead today's equilibrium unemployment rate to depend on past realizations of unemployment. One relies on the fact that the unemployed lose the opportunity to acquire human capital through on-thejob training and lose the habit of working. The other relies on an hypothesized inverse effect of increased union employment on the markup of union over nonunion wag \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 603)
\par
\guillemotleft{} Empirical evidence that such state dependence might be important was furnished by Coe (1985) who showed that the fit of Phillips curves for a number of OECD countries could be improved by specifying the natural rate as a moving average of past unemployment rates. Only recently, however, have attempts been made to model the various sources of persistence in detail and to discriminate between them. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 603)

\guillemotleft{} One important strand of the literature develops the idea that the level of wages is decided largely by those who are presently employed, with little or no attention paid to the interests of the unemployed. A key feature is thus the assumption that the present work force cannot easily be replaced by new workers drawn from the ranks of the unemployed. \guillemotright{} (Bean, 1994, p. 603)},

In this paper, I address the case of Edmond Malinvaud, who began opposing the New Classical Economics from the early 1980s and did so throughout the following thirty years. This study shows that his opposition was radical, i.e., multi-dimensional and systematic, and owes to the methodology and the practice of macroeconometric modeling. In turn, this twofold result sheds light on the nature and the rationale of the Old Keynesians' opposition to the New Classical Economics from the 1970s onwards, which can be interpreted along the same lines.},

In an attempt to reconcile the conflicting findings, Monte Carlo experiments are used to demonstrate that if the Davidson et al. model were actually correct the Hall model would appear to give a good description of the data and would probably not be rejected. All the models are re-estimated with new data for the UK, and these data do reject a modified `random-walk' specification. In conclusion, we discuss the issue of income exogeneity, and comment on questions of model selection and interpretation.},

  abstract = {The structure of labour markets is increasingly perceived as a determinant of the macroeconomic performance of a country. This article focuses on one aspect of labour markets, the degree of centralization of wage setting. The main conclusion is that extremes work best. Either highly centralized systems with national bargaining (such as in Austria and the Nordic countries), or highly decentralized systems with wage setting at the level of individual firms (such as in Japan, Switzerland and the US) seem to perform well. The worst outcomes with respect to employment may well be found in systems with an intermediate degree of centralization (such as in Belgium and the Netherlands). This conclusion is reasonably well supported by the available empirical evidence. It is also logical. Indeed, large and all-encompassing trade unions naturally recognize their market power and take into account both the inflationary and unemployment effects of wage increases. Conversely, unions operating at the individual firm or plant level have very limited market power. In intermediate cases, unions can exert some market power but are led to ignore the macroeconomic implications of their actions. These conclusions challenge the conventional wisdom which asserts that the more 'corporatist' is an economy, the better is its economic performance.},

In particular, the paper stresses the macroeconomic consequences of the interaction between endogenous utility-maximizing governments and labour unions, and shows how the response of the economy to changes in government and union behaviour depends on the preferences of both parties with respect to inflation, employment, real disposable wages, and government spending as well as on their view of the relative magnitude of the employment and price effects of such changes.},

This paper applies two models of repeated games to analyze the strategic interaction between an exchange rate setting policy maker and a wage setting trade union. It is shown how a devaluation-wage spiral may result from a conflict of interest over the real wage. It is also shown how reputational forces may provide a way out of the devaluation-wage spiral.},

But, although these inflation surprises can have some benefits, they cannot arise systematically in equilibrium when people understand the policymaker's incentives and form their expectations accordingly. Because the policymaker has the power to create inflation shocks ex post, the equilibrium growth rates of money and prices turn out to be higher than otherwise. Therefore, enforced commitments (rules) for monetary behavior can improve matters. Given the repeated interaction between the policymaker and the private agents, it is possible that reputational forces can substitute for formal rules. Here, we develop an example of a reputational equilibrium where the outcomes turn out to be weighted averages of those from discretion and those from the ideal rule. In particular, the rates of inflation and monetary growth look more like those under discretion when the discount rate is high.},

Then, we find that (1) the rates of monetary growth and inflation are excessive; (2) these rates depend on the slope of Phillips curve, the natural unemployment rate, and other variables that affect the benefits and costs from inflation; (3) the monetary authority behaves countercyclically; and (4) unemployment is independent of money policy. Outcomes improve if rules commit future policy choices in the appropriate manner. The value of these commitments--which amount to long-term contracts between the government and the private sector--underlies the argument for rules over discretion.},

The reason for this apparent paradox is that economic planning is not a game against nature but, rather, a game against rational economic agents.

Both the `simplest test' and the `drift adjustment' method are used. The simplest test adjusts interest rate differentials for the maximum and minimum expected rate of depreciation within the exchange rate band; the drift- adjustment method adjusts interest rate differentials by the estimated expected rate of depreciation within the band. The latter method gives more precise estimates, especially for short horizons, and allows statistical inference and hypothesis testing. Expected rates of devaluation have generally fallen during the period. Still, some devaluation expectations relative to the Deutsche mark remain in 1992, except for the Belgian/Luxembourg franc and the Netherlands guilder. Expected rates of devaluation have fluctuated more than interest rate differentials.},

  abstract = {Inflation targeting is shown to imply inflation forecast targeting: the central bank's inflation forecast becomes an explicit intermediate target. Inflation forecast targeting simplifies both implementation and monitoring of monetary policy. The weight on output stabilization determines how quickly the inflation forecast is adjusted towards the inflation target. Money growth or exchange rate targeting is generally inferior than inflation targeting and leads to higher inflation variability. Commitment to `target rules' may be better than commitment to `instrument rules'.},

  abstract = {This paper constructs a theoretical model to study the effects on employment of the introduction of flexible labor contracts (i.e., with low firing costs), which occurred in many European countries in the 1980s, and tests it with Spanish data. The model predicts that these contracts increase the size of employment's response to aggregate shocks, while decreasing its persistence. Also, at the time these contracts are introduced, employment overshoots its long-run level. An econometric estimation of labor demand with a panel of large Spanish industrial firms validates several of the model's implications, in particular the increase in employment's cyclical response.},

It focuses on the emigration of German-speaking economists after 1933; and then deals with the special case of Jacob Marschak who emigrated twice, first from the Soviet Union in 1919 and then from Nazi Germany, and exerted a greater influence in Britain and in the USA. Finally important contributions by \'emigr\'e economists to game theory, public finance and development economics are reflected.},
