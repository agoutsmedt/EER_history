\begin{abstract}
Economics in Europe has become more international since the 1970s. To a
certain extent, this internationalisation is also an `Americanisation'
as many European economists have adopted the standards and approaches of
US economics. This raises the question of whether there remain or have
emerged any fields that are distinctively European.

In this article, we use topic modelling and bibliometric coupling to
identify European specialities between 1969 and 2002. We focus on
macroeconomics, and we use the articles published in the European
Economic Review and compare their bibliographic references and textual
content (\emph{via} titles and abstracts) to what has been published in
the top 5 journals.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, disequilibrium theory constituted a
significant part of the research undertaken by European macroeconomists,
and did not limit to the general equilibrium theory, but also
represented a unifying framework to deal with different macroeconomic
issues. After it lost its influence in the second part of the 1980s,
political economy occupied this role. It constituted a resource for
tackling the issues raised by the European integration and the building
of a European monetary system, and constituted a common language for
many European macroeconomists.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In 1987 in the \emph{European Economic Review}, the director of the
Centre for Economic Policy Research, Richard Portes, assessed the
``state and status of economics in Europe''. He regarded ``the standard
of comparison {[}as{]} obvious: the United States, by far the dominant
producer'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-portes1987}{Portes, 1987, p. 1329}).
He then asked ``whether there is now any economics outside and
independent of the United States.'' (p.~1330) He listed many clues
testifying US domination, ending by the observation that ``the leaders
of the economics profession in Europe were trained as postgraduates in
the United States. Many take from the US their professional standards,
their views of what are the interesting problems, and their approaches
to them'' (\emph{ibid.}).

Indeed, in the early 1970s, economics in many Western European countries
experienced a process of internationalisation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-fourcade2009}{Fourcade, 2009, chap. 3} and 4;
\protect\hyperlink{ref-fourcade2006}{Fourcade, 2006}).\footnote{The
  circulation of economic ideas has always been relatively
  internationalised, and examples of the circulation of knowledge and
  economists prior to the 1970s abound (e.g.
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-hagemann2011a}{Hagemann, 2011};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-hesse2012}{Hesse, 2012}). However, we observe a
  significant acceleration of this process after the 1970s
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-coats1996}{Coats, 1996}), albeit with
  different national rhythms (e.g.
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-backhouse1997a}{Backhouse, 1997}).} This
internationalisation was, to some extent, a form of ``Americanisation''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-coats1996}{Coats, 1996};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-goutsmedt2021}{Goutsmedt et al., 2021}): US
professional and intellectual standards were progressively adopted in
European countries, mimicking the functioning of the US academic field.
English emerged as the dominant language in economics
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sandelin1997}{Sandelin and Ranki, 1997}), and
publications in peer-review journals became the norm for assessing
research productivity. The organisation of international events was
encouraged to enhance the visibility of research centres
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-cherrier2021}{Cherrier and Saïdi, 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-goutsmedt2021}{Goutsmedt et al., 2021}). In terms
of content, the Americanisation of the discipline in Europe favoured the
spreading of intellectual standards that had become widespread in the US
during the postwar era (\protect\hyperlink{ref-morgan1998}{Morgan and
Rutherford, 1998}): the use of mathematical economics and econometrics,
and the reliance on neoclassical theory as a benchmark for
modelling.\footnote{Of course, this process of Americanisation was not
  without its share of conflicts: ``local conflicts'' frequently arose
  between economists who were ``nationally-trained'' and those who were
  ``internationally-trained'', particularly in the US
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-fourcade2006}{Fourcade, 2006}). These
  conflicts encompassed intellectual issues, such as debates over the
  relevance of neoclassical theory, as well as institutional matters,
  including the criteria for evaluating the quality of economists' work,
  and thus for determining hiring and promotion decisions.}

In parallel to this Americanisation, we observe a process of
`Europeanisation': many initiatives from the first issue of the
\emph{European Economic Review} (EER) in 1969 to the creation of the
\emph{European Economic Association} (EEA) in 1984 promoted the
development of intellectual exchanges between European
economists---while obviously keeping US economics as a model. The
simultaneous spreading of US standards in Europe after the 1970s and the
promotion of a European economics transcending national traditions bring
us back to Portes's 1987 question: could a distinct European approach to
economics develop and maintain a degree of autonomy from the US in the
years following the 1970s?

Portes pointed out some European ``comparative advantages''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-portes1987}{Portes, 1987, p. 1332}), even though
some of these European specialities had been initially pioneered by US
economists. He mentioned the prominence in Europe of ``general
equilibrium theory,'' ``international macroeconomic policy
coordination,'' or ``Non-Walrasian macroeconomics'' (\emph{ibid}.).
Goutsmedt et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-goutsmedt2021}{2021}) have also
highlighted that within the \emph{International Seminar on
Macroeconomics} (ISoM), whose annual proceedings were published in the
EER, disequilibrium macroeconomics and large-scale macroeconometric
modelling constituted important rallying research programs until the
mid-1980s for European economists involved in the ISoM.\footnote{In the
  rest of the article, we follow Backhouse and Boianovsky and use the
  expression ``disequilibrium macroeconomics'' to designate a research
  program that has been labelled in many ways: ``non-Walrasian theory,
  disequilibrium theory, equilibrium with rationing,
  \emph{non-tâtonnement} theory, fixed-price models''
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-backhouseboianovski2013}{Backhouse and
  Boianovsky, 2013, pp. 8--9}).}

The purpose of our article is to investigate systematically and
quantitatively the development and persistence of European specificities
in macroeconomics. Macroeconomics constituted a substantial part of
EER's publications, even representing almost half of all the articles in
the early 1980s (Figure \ref{fig:plot-jel}). Macroeconomics was also
instrumental in fostering collaborations between European economists as
evidenced by the ISoM (see Section \ref{rising-journal}). Regarding EER
history and its significance in the promotion of a European
macroeconomics, we believe that EER publications constitutes a
compelling perspective from which to examine the evolution of a European
``mainstream'' macroeconomics, as well as of the emergence and
persistence of ``European specialities'' within the field (see Section
\ref{EER-creation} for further insights on this point).\footnote{We use
  ``mainstream'' as a convenient way to indicate that our focus is on a
  specific subset of macroeconomics, which adhered to certain standards
  and fundamental theoretical assumptions, inspired by US economists.
  Several alternative approaches, such as Marxian and Sraffian economics
  or British Keynesianism and post-Keynesianism, held strong roots in
  Europe. Yet, they were considerably less likely to be featured in
  publications within the EER.} We define European specialities as
\emph{(i)} prevalent research themes (i.e.~representing a substantial
portion of European macroeconomists' research) \emph{(ii)} distinct from
what US-based economists were doing and \emph{(iii)} embraced by
Europe-based economists affiliated with a diverse array of institutions
across different European countries. This final criterion resonates with
the idea of a ``Europeanisation'': in the subsequent analysis, we take
care to differentiate between research areas predominantly established
in a single European country and those encompassing multiple countries,
fostering collaborations among macroeconomists across Western
Europe.\footnote{Up until 2002, economists from Eastern Europe were
  scarcely represented. For the sake of simplicity, we will use the term
  Europe.} Employing a combination of bibliometric coupling, topic
modelling and content reading, we pinpoint European specialities in the
period spanning 1973 to 2002.\footnote{The corpus we use (see section
  \ref{methods}) has very few abstracts between 1969 (the date of the
  creation of the EER) and 1972. Besides, there is no JEL code for EER
  articles before 1973, preventing us for identifying macroeconomics
  articles. After 2002 and the creation of the
  \href{https://academic.oup.com/jeea}{\emph{Journal of the European
  Economic Association}}, the EER was not the official journal of the
  EEA any more.}

The interplay between the internationalisation of macroeconomics and the
persistence of specialities presents a compelling avenue to contribute
to the foundation of a history of European macroeconomics, an area that
remains largely unexplored. Over the last decade, many historical
contributions have documented the evolution of macroeconomics in the
1970s and 1980s. These contributions have identified the major
trajectories of the discipline's transformation (especially the changes
brought about by new classical economists' contributions) and examined
the extent to which macroeconomics' methodology has evolved
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-devroey2016}{De Vroey, 2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-duartelima2012a}{Duarte and Lima, 2012}).
Historians have also underlined the discontinuities within these
transformations, as well as the resistance against them
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-goutsmedt2021b}{Goutsmedt, 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-goutsmedtetal2019}{Goutsmedt et al., 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-renault2020a}{Renault, 2020}), their varying
impact on applied and empirical works
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-boumans2019}{Boumans and Duarte, 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-qin2013a}{Qin, 2013};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-renault2022}{Renault, 2022a}), but also the
existence of alternative theoretical research programmes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-backhouseboianovski2013}{Backhouse and
Boianovsky, 2013}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-cherrier2018c}{Cherrier and
Saïdi, 2018}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-hoover2012}{Hoover, 2012}).
Nevertheless, these historical contributions remained generally
US-centred. This can be readily attributed to the predominant influence
of US macroeconomists on the discipline, bolstered by the
internationalisation process previously discussed. Yet, it remains
essential to comprehend how European macroeconomics may have diverged
from the dominant US macroeconomics, how it has evolved at a distinct
pace, pursued alternative trajectories, and focussed on differing
issues. Furthermore, our article broadens the scope of historical
investigation to include the 1990s, a period that has yet not been
thoroughly explored by historians.

Our approach identifies different \emph{bibliometric clusters} and
\emph{topics} that are overly associated to publication in the EER
(rather than in top 5 journals) and to Europe-based economists (see
Section \ref{methods} for details on method).\footnote{We focus on
  affiliations rather than nationality. Beyond the fact that data on
  nationality may be challenging to get, we understand ``European
  macroeconomics'' as the macroeconomics developed in Europe. The terms
  ``Europe-based'' and ``US-based'' are used to clarify that the
  discussion revolves around affiliations. However, for the sake of
  brevity, we may sometimes use the term ``European macroeconomists''.}
This approach provides insights into the research areas European
macroeconomists focused on from the 1970s to the 1990s, in contrast to
their US counterparts. A meticulous examination of the detailed findings
allows us to paint a broader, albeit not complete, portrait of the
evolution of European macroeconomics since the 1970s.\footnote{The
  article is also accompanied by a detailed methodological
  \protect\hyperlink{appendix}{Appendix}, as well as two online
  appendices listing the features of the bibliometric clusters
  (``Bibliographic information about the EER and details on the
  bibliographic coupling clusters'') and of the topics identified by our
  topic model (``Details on the topics'').}

In line with the claims made by Portes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-portes1987}{1987}) and Goutsmedt et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-goutsmedt2021}{2021}), disequilibrium theory
emerges as a unifying framework for European macroeconomics between the
mid-1970s and the mid-1980s. If initially it served as a theoretical
research program aimed at advancing general equilibrium theory, it also
became an interpretative framework for explaining stagflation and the
European unemployment problem following the 1970s (see Section
\ref{disequilibrium}). Disequilibrium theory---and notably Malinvaud's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-malinvaud1977}{1977}) distinction between
Keynesian and classical unemployment---provided a common ground for
European macroeconomists when addressing various macroeconomic issues.
Even those who disagreed with its relevance made their dissent explicit.
Consequently, its influence was far more extended than the contributions
of new classical economists like Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent or Robert
Barro, which were largely overlooked by most European macroeconomists
(see Section \ref{opposition-trends}).

However, the disequilibrium line of research gradually faded after the
mid-1980s and issues like European unemployment were tackled using
alternative frameworks (see Section \ref{disequilibrium-fall} and
\ref{unemployment}). While no single unifying and consistent theoretical
framework replaced disequilibrium theory, the new political economy
inspired by Kydland and Prescott
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kydland1977}{1977}) and Barro and Gordon
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1983}{1983a},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1983c}{1983b}) brought new questions and a
shared language for many contributions by European economists (see
Section \ref{political-economics}). Although the pioneering
contributions of this literature were conducted by US economists, it
became a distinctly European approach for tackling many macroeconomic
issues in the 1990s.

\subsection{The birth of a european
project}\label{the-birth-of-a-european-project}}

In 1969, Jean Waelbroeck and Herbert Glejser, both from the
\emph{Université Libre de Bruxelles} (ULB), launched the \emph{European
Economic Review}. The new review was planned to be the official journal
of the European Scientific Association of Applied Economics (ASEPELT),
which had been created in 1961 by Waelbroeck and another ULB economist:
Etienne Kirschen. Before 1969, this association published in English a
bulletin gathering research in econometrics and mathematical economics
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-waelbroeck1969}{Waelbroeck and Glejser, 1969, p.
4}). The EER took up this torch by publishing the same type of research.
Articles had to be published in English, the new ``\emph{lingua franca}
of economics'' triggering the process of ``internationalisation of our
science'' as Waelbroeck and Glejser polemically stated in the
introduction of the first issue (\emph{ibid.}).

The birth of such a project in Belgium is far from coincidental. Indeed,
the country exhibited a high effervescence regarding the
internationalisation of the discipline. In 1966, Jacques Drèze had
established the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics (CORE)
at the \emph{Katholieke Universiteit Leuven} (before its split), drawing
inspiration from the Cowles Commission and the Carnegie Institute of
Technology, which Drèze had visited in the 1950s
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-duppe2017}{Düppe, 2017}).\footnote{KU Leuven was
  split in 1968 between a Flemish and a French-speaking part, the latter
  giving birth to the \emph{Université Catholique de Louvain} at
  Louvain-La-Neuve, where the CORE eventually moved in the mid-1970s.}
The CORE developed a research program around macroeconomic modelling and
general equilibrium theory, and quickly stimulated the establishment of
a European research network of economists, notably through its large
visiting programme (\protect\hyperlink{ref-duppe2017}{Düppe, 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-maes2005}{Maes and Buyst, 2005}). Encouraged by
Waelbroeck, the ULB department of economics joined the CORE in its first
years of existence (\protect\hyperlink{ref-maes2005}{Maes and Buyst,
2005, p. 79}).

From the beginning, the EER was conceived as a European project and the
composition of the editorial board testifies of it (Table
\ref{tab:table-boards}). But the EER being a Belgian-centred initiative,
Belgian institutions represented one fifth of authors' affiliations in
EER articles in the first years (Table
\ref{tab:table-authors}).\footnote{This is an approximation, as the
  affiliation per author is not available in our corpus and we only have
  the affiliations per article (see
  \protect\hyperlink{author-affiliation}{Appendix B.2.} for more
  details).{]}} Nonetheless, the geographical diversity of EER
authorship expanding significantly during the 1970s. When comparing
authors' affiliations data from \emph{The Economic Journal} and
\emph{Economica} as calculated in Backhouse
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-backhouse1997a}{1997, fig. 7} and 8), we see
that European countries excluding the UK were far better represented in
the EER.\footnote{In contrast to \emph{The Economic Journal} and
  \emph{Economica}, where British and US affiliations accounted
  approximately for 80\% of authors from the 1970s to the 1990s, these
  affiliations represented merely 30 to 45 percent in the EER.
  Meanwhile, European countries (excluding the UK) represented between
  40 and 50 percent in the EER.}

The EER was one of these crucial initiatives that contributed to a
Europeanisation of economics and the development of intellectual
exchanges between European based economists
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-goutsmedt2021}{Goutsmedt et al.,

  institutions with which economists are affiliated, rather than their
  nationality (which is difficult to ascertain). Consequently,
  throughout the rest of the article, we will refer to ``European-based
  authors'' or ``US-based authors''. However, for the sake of brevity,
  we may occasionally employ more concise phrasing (such as ``Europeans
  economists'') to prevent the text from becoming overly cumbersome.}
The centrality of the journal was strengthened in 1984 when the European
Economic Association was created, and the EER was established as the
official journal of the new association.

\hypertarget{rising-journal}{%
\subsection{A rising european journal}\label{rising-journal}}

Besides offering a common platform for European economists, the journal
initial goal was also to encourage the promotion of a US-style approach
to economics. An important dimension of the journal's evolution was thus
the progressive integration of US-based economists. The ``International
Seminar on Macroeconomics,'' (ISoM) co-organized by the French
\emph{Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales} and the US National
Bureau of Economic Research, played a key role in that integration of US
economists, as the conference papers were published each year in a
special issue (\protect\hyperlink{ref-goutsmedt2021}{Goutsmedt et al.,
2021}). The ISoM also contributed to the journal's major focus on
macroeconomics in the 1980s (Figure \ref{fig:plot-jel}).\footnote{There
  were very few macroeconomic articles in 1979 due to the confluence of
  two factors: fewer articles were published this year with only one
  volume against two in preceding and subsequent years; JEL codes were
  missing for most EER article this year.}

During the 1970s, the share of US-based authors publishing in the
journal grew steadily and reached a third of all affiliations in the
early 1980s (Table \ref{tab:table-authors}). The rising involvement of
US economists in the EER signified not just an increase in articles
published by US-based authors, but also a rise in collaborations between
US and European economists (Figure \ref{fig:plot-collabs}). Although
there were no collaborations in the journal's inaugural year, by 1980,
10 percent of the published articles featured joint writing between
institutions from the US and Europe.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\footnotetext{While the 'European authors', 'US authors' and 'EU-US collaboration' categories are computed on the overall corpus, the 'Intra EU Collab category' is computed on EER papers written by European authors ('Europe Only' category).}

In the mid-1980s, the journal thus emerged as a symbol of a more
integrated European economics, taking inspiration from the US standards
and enticing numerous US economists to contribute. Also, its
intellectual impact has seemingly broadened: the journal ascended as a
pre-eminent publication in macroeconomics, gradually surpassing other
prominent European journals regarding bibliographic citations (Figure
\ref{fig:plot-eer-importance-macro}).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../../../../../../../Mon Drive/data/EER/pictures/Graphs/EER_importance_macro_minimal_bw}

\caption{Share of citations from macroeconomics articles to the EER and the main european journals (smoothed using local polynomial regression)\protect\footnotemark}\label{fig:plot-eer-importance-macro}
\end{figure}

\footnotetext{We count only references to articles published after 1969, the inaugural year of the EER. We have also looked at the \textit{Scandinavian Journal of Economics}, \textit{Oxford Economic Papers}, and \textit{Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv}, which remain steadily under 0.5\%. Graphs including these journals can be found in the online appendix.}

The question that remains is whether this process of
internationalisation resulted in the complete standardisation of
European macroeconomics based on the US model, or if it allowed for the
cultivation and persistence of distinctly European specialities.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods for identifying European specialities}\label{methods}}

To identify European specialities, we compare macroeconomics articles
published in the EER and in the Top 5 journals (\emph{American Economic
Review}, \emph{Journal of Political Economy}, \emph{Econometrica},
\emph{Quarterly Journal of Economics}, \emph{Review of Economic
Studies}). Choosing a list of journals for a comparison is always, to a
certain extent, arbitrary. However, choosing the Top 5 journals offers
certain benefits. First, even though these journals may not have
consistently been regarded as the ``Top 5'' over our entire
investigation period, they have maintained their status as major
economic journals, where prominent macroeconomists used to publish.
Consequently, macroeconomic papers published in these journals are more
likely to represent a ``mainstream'' in macroeconomics, widely accepted
and disseminated.\footnote{Including more specialised journals would
  rather reveal emerging trends that have not yet become mainstream.}.
Second, these 5 journals are diverse enough to accommodate a broad range
of macroeconomic articles, such as highly theoretical or empirical
pieces. In sum, the Top 5 journals serve as a stable reference point
between 1969 and 2002 to draw comparisons with the EER, facilitating a
deeper understanding of EER publications' main
characteristics.\footnote{Incorporating more journals might have
  introduced the risks of adding noise, stemming from significant
  variations in editorship and primary features of some journals used
  for comparison.} Moreover, the EER was founded with the intention of
establishing an elite, leading journal for the European community that
would mimic the standards of the leading US journals. Therefore, the Top
5 seems a suitable benchmark for comparison with the EER.\footnote{It
  should be noted that we also examine the content published in
  macroeconomics in the EER independently of the comparison with the Top
  5, meaning the comparison is not the sole driver of our analysis.}

We identify macroeconomics articles by using the former and new JEL
codes classifications (\protect\hyperlink{ref-jel1991}{JEL,
1991}).\footnote{See the complete list of all the JEL codes we have used
  in \protect\hyperlink{eer-top5-macro}{Appendix B.1.} Using JEL codes
  as a classification method is more conventional and less arbitrary
  than creating our own system. This approach occasionally incorporates
  articles that may not seem overtly ``macroeconomic'', either because
  of misclassification or due to old JEL codes mixing subjects that were
  not ``macroeconomics'' in the new classification. However,
  bibliometric coupling and topic modelling isolate articles that
  deviate significantly from the ``average'' macroeconomic content or
  group them based on their similarities. Consequently, articles that do
  not directly pertain to macroeconomics can be set aside and do not
  affect our general results.} In addition to JEL codes data, we have
employed three distinct databases to collect various types of
information: outside of basic metadata (such year of publication, title,
authors, \emph{etc.}), we have collected bibliographic references of EER
and Top 5 articles, abstracts, and authors' affiliations.\footnote{Crossing
  databases has been necessary due to missing years and information in
  the different databases we have used (\emph{Web of Science},
  \emph{Scopus} and \emph{Microsoft Academic Premier}). See
  \protect\hyperlink{corpus}{Appendix B.1.} for more details on the
  building of our dataset.} Then, we conduct two types of analysis to
identify European specialities: bibliographic coupling and topic
modelling.

\hypertarget{bibliographic-coupling}{%
\subsection{Bibliographic coupling}\label{bibliographic-coupling}}

Bibliographic coupling connects articles together depending on the
bibliographic references they share. We build different relational
networks using EER and Top 5 articles (the nodes of the network),
connected by weighted links (the edges of the network), depending on the
number of references shared between two articles.\footnote{For more
  details on the measure of weights, see
  \protect\hyperlink{network}{Appendix B.3.}} To closely examine the
evolution of macroeconomic content, we build networks using a moving
eight-year window (based on the publication year of the articles). We
thus have 23 networks from the 1973-1980 period, through 1974-1981,
1975-1982, and so on, up to 1995-2002. For each network, we employ the
Leiden algorithm (\protect\hyperlink{ref-traag2019}{Traag et al., 2019})
to identify bibliographic clusters, i.e.~groups of articles sharing
numerous significant references with other articles of their cluster,
and fewer with articles outside their cluster. Articles within the same
cluster are more likely to share cognitive content (e.g., sharing
objects of study, methods, results or theory) even if disagreeing
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-claveau2016}{Claveau and Gingras, 2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-goutsmedt2021}{Goutsmedt et al., 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-truc2021}{Truc et al., 2021}). Finally, we look
at the similarity of the clusters two by two for successive networks
(i.e.~networks of successive time windows), and merge clusters from
different networks together when they are sufficiently close.\footnote{See
  \protect\hyperlink{network}{Appendix B.3.} for details on the merging
  criteria.}

This process allows us to obtain intertemporal clusters. Academic
articles predominantly cite references published in recent years.
Building a network spanning the entire period (1973-2002) would likely
lead to group articles based on their publication date rather than
shared intellectual content. By employing short time windows and then by
merging clusters from networks of different time windows, we circumvent
this problem and can identify clusters spanning longer periods of time,
thus allowing for a comprehensive historical analysis. We identify a
total of 154 intertemporal clusters but only 33 that are \emph{(i)}
present in at least 2 networks (i.e.~2 successive time windows) and
\emph{(ii)} represent more than 0.04 percent of the nodes of at least
one of the network they belong.\footnote{We confine our investigation to
  these prominent intertemporal clusters.}

A range of indicators helps us to discern the content of these
intertemporal clusters---e.g.~the words used in abstracts and titles,
recurring authors, the most important nodes or the most cited
references.\footnote{This information is collected for each cluster in
  the online appendix ``Bibliographic information about the EER and
  details on the bibliographic coupling clusters''.} These indicators
informed our labeling of the clusters.

Subsequently, for each intertemporal cluster, we determine the US or
European orientation of its publications (the nodes) and authors. We
assess the over/under representation of Europe- and US-based authors in
the cluster and the over/under representation of the EER and top 5
journals, using a log of ratios.\footnote{Our assumption is that the
  content of articles published in the Top 5 by European economists
  could be more largely influenced by the standards of Top 5 journals
  and of US macroeconomics, and thus could be less representative of
  European economics than the articles published in the EER.} These two
measures inform us on which are the most `European' clusters, meaning
those where relatively more articles are published in the EER and by
Europe-based economists.\footnote{Table \ref{tab:summary-communities}
  lists the 33 most significant clusters with the two measures.
  \protect\hyperlink{network}{Appendix B.3.} explains the method and
  displays a flow chart of the distribution of clusters over the
  different networks and the flows of articles between the different
  clusters from one network to another in successive time windows.}
Regarding European and US authors, for each time window, we compute the
\emph{(i)} share of articles written by European authors and US authors
in each cluster, and \emph{(ii)} the overall share of European authors
and US authors. Then, for each cluster, we average its relative shares
per time window across all the time windows in which the cluster exists:

\bigskip

\({\scriptstyle \text{Log of ratios EU/US }=\log(\frac{(\frac{\text{Mean Share of European Authored Articles in the Cluster}}{\text{Mean Share of US Authored Articles in the Cluster}})} {(\frac{\text{Overall Mean Share of European Authored Articles in Cluster's Time Window}}{\text{Overall Mean Share of US Authored Articles in Cluster's Time Window}})})}\)
\bigskip

We then use a second similar index for the publication venue of the
articles in the cluster:

\bigskip

\({\scriptstyle \text{Log of ratios EER/Top5 }=\log(\frac{(\frac{\text{Mean Share of EER Articles in the Cluster}}{\text{1-Mean Share of EER Articles in the Cluster}})} {(\frac{\text{Overall Mean Share of EER Articles in Cluster's Time Window}}{\text{1-Overall Mean Share of EER Articles in Cluster's Time Window}})})}\)
\bigskip

Figure \ref{fig:plot-community-diff} displays the position of each
cluster relatively to these two measures on a two-dimensional graph with
the X-axis for the log of ratios of Europe and US authors, and the
Y-Axis for the log of ratios of Top 5 and EER. The size of the points
captures the number of articles in the cluster.\footnote{To verify the
  robustness of our index, we also test two alternatives indexes giving
  similar results (see \protect\hyperlink{alt-index}{Appendix B.3.}}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{topic-modelling}{%
\subsection{Topic modelling}\label{topic-modelling}}

We apply topic modelling to our corpus, which is constituted of all the
titles and abstracts (when available) of the macroeconomic articles
published in the EER and Top 5. As a first step, we extract (or
`tokenise') ``ngrams'': unique words (or unigrams), bigrams and
trigrams. We exclude stop words and other uninformative words and
`lemmatise' remaining ngrams.\footnote{See the
  \protect\hyperlink{topic}{Appendix B.4.} for more details on the
  preprocessing steps we use.} Topic modelling is a unsupervised machine
learning method that identifies patterns and themes in the corpus by
clustering similar words and phrases into \(k\) ``topics''.
Specifically, for each topic, the method returns a set of probabilities
\(\beta\) for a ngram to be used in the topic. The \emph{ngrams} with
the highest \(\beta\) for a topic allows to understand what the topic is
about. Second, for each document in the corpus (i.e.~each article title
and abstract), the method returns a set of probabilities \(\gamma\) for
each topic to be mentioned in the document. The topics with the highest
\(\gamma\) for a document allows to understand what the document is
talking about. To estimate our topic model, we use a variant of the
Latent Dirichlet Allocation model called the Correlated Topic Model
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-blei2007}{Blei and Lafferty, 2007}). The number
of topics \emph{k} is chosen after evaluating different models
quantitatively and qualitatively. We choose to run the model with 50
topics, which allows us to better capture the diversity of topics
discussed in the corpus.\footnote{\protect\hyperlink{topic}{Appendix
  B.4.} gives more details on the different models we have tested and
  how we have set the number of topics.}

Table \ref{tab:summary-topics} lists all the topics identified with
their most representative words and expressions.\footnote{To select the
  most representative words for each topic, we use \emph{FREX} rather
  than \(\beta\) values (\protect\hyperlink{ref-bischof2012}{Bischof and
  Airoldi, 2012}). FREX is the weighted harmonic mean of the ngram's
  exclusivity and frequency. Exclusivity is a measure of how much a term
  is used in a topic compared to its frequency in others. By using FREX
  rather than \(\beta\) values, we can highlight the words that most
  strongly identify each topic, rather than highlighting more common
  words that may also appear in other topics.} We also use a set of
indicators, like the most cited references per topic crossed with the
journal and affiliation variables, to get a better picture of what the
topics are and what are their European and non-European
dimensions.\footnote{This information is collected in the online
  Appendix ``Details on the topics''.}

Similarly to bibliometric coupling, we are interested in the topics
characteristics regarding the publications (EER \emph{vs.} Top 5) and
the countries of affiliations of the authors (the US \emph{vs.} European
countries). For each topic, we only keep the articles that are the most
associated to the topic, with \(\gamma > 0.1\). We then assess the
over/under representation of EER articles for each topic, by calculating
the log odds ratio in comparison to top 5 articles:

\[
\text{log odds ratio EER/Top5 for topic }i = ln(\frac{[\frac{N_{\text{EER in topic }i}+1}{N_{\text{topic }i} + 1}]_{EER}}{[\frac{N_{\text{Top5 in topic }i}+1}{N_{\text{topic }i} + 1}]_{Top5}})
\]

with \(N_{\text{EER in topic }i}\) the number of EER articles in the
topic and \(N_{\text{topic }i}\) the total number of articles in the
topic. We perform the same calculation for articles written exclusively
by Europe-based authors or US-based authors. The two log odds ratios are
plotted in a two-dimensional graph (Figure \ref{fig:plot-topic-diff}) to
observe which topics are over-represented in the EER and more frequently
mentioned by Europe-based authors.\footnote{Refer to
  \protect\hyperlink{topic}{Appendix B.4.} for details on the measure
  and the results using an alternative measure that does not employ
  \(\gamma\) as a threshold.}

The combination of two distinct unsupervised methods enables us to
systematically identify potential European specialities.\footnote{To our
  knowledge, this article represents the first attempt to combine both
  methods to describe the evolution of the state of economics. Utilising
  both approaches is essential to ensure the robustness of our results
  and systematically verify if a distinctly ``European'' cluster can be
  associated with one or several ``European'' topics, and conversely.}
Figures \ref{fig:plot-community-diff} and \ref{fig:plot-topic-diff}
provide a synthetic visualisation of our results: the upper right
portion of both graphs showcases the topics and clusters that gather
articles with an over-representation of EER article compared to the Top
5 and wand an over-representation of Europe-based authors compared to
US-based authors. The in-depth qualitative analysis of clusters and
topics then provide a comprehensive overview of the various issues,
methods and theoretical questions investigated by European
macroeconomists, in comparison to US macroeconomics. For each cluster
and topics, we can observe the most influential EER articles, as well as
the most cited references by EER articles and Europe-based authors. This
allows us to comprehend what is published in the EER and to connect
these publications to broader lines of research (and thus to articles by
Europe-based authors published in other journals).

In the final two sections, we delve into these more ``European''
clusters and topics to understand the evolving characteristics of
European macroeconomics. The corresponding data has been systematically
analysed to build our historical narrative. From this investigation, we
identify two main periods: the 1970s to mid-1980s; the mid-1980s to late
1990s).

\section{The 1970s to mid-1980s: A Gradual Europeanisation in Opposition
to US
Macroeconomics}\label{the-1970s-to-mid-1980s-a-gradual-europeanisation-in-opposition-to-us-macroeconomics}}

In contrast to the literature in the history of macroeconomics, which
emphasizes the transformations of macroeconomics in response to debates
on microfoundations and the emergence of new classical economics,
European macroeconomics took a distinct path. European macroeconomists
remained distant from many of the theoretical debates triggered by
microfoundations, including those concerning the rational expectations
and the Phillips curve, the demand for money, or the consumption
function. Instead, they focused on more empirical studies, but also
their own microfoundational program through the disequilibrium theory.

\hypertarget{opposition-trends}{%
\subsection{Opposition to New Trends in US
Macroeconomics}\label{opposition-trends}}

The analysis of topics and clusters allows us to understand first what
European macroeconomics \emph{was not} in this period. Several
literatures seem to be ignored by the Europeans in the EER. That is the
case of the debates around the life-cycle and permanent income
hypotheses, influenced by Friedman
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-friedman1957}{1957}) and Hall
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hall1978b}{1978}).\footnote{See clusters
  ``Intergenerational model, Savings \& Consumption'' and ``Permanent
  Income and Life-Cycle Hypotheses'', as well as topics 12 and 14. This
  literature sought to introduce structural heterogeneity in life cycle
  or permanent income models (see Cherrier, Duarte and Saïdi, this
  issue).}

Other more US-oriented areas dealt with \emph{(i)} the demand for
money---for which Baumol (\protect\hyperlink{ref-baumol1952}{1952}) and
Friedman and Schwartz (\protect\hyperlink{ref-friedman1963}{1963}) were
central references---as well as \emph{(ii)} the ``new classical monetary
theory'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hoover1988}{Hoover, 1988, chap. 6}) of
the 1970s inspired by Sargent's, Bryant's and Wallace's works
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bryant1979}{Bryant and Wallace, 1979};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-sargent1982}{Sargent and Wallace,
1982}).\footnote{See clusters ``Monetary Economics \& Demand for Money''
  and ``Demand for Money'', as well as Topic 2 on the demand for money
  and money supply, which is one of the most non-European topic, and
  Topic 19 on demand for money and term structure of interest rates.}
The new classical monetary theory of the 1970s is described by Hoover
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hoover1988}{1988, p. 111}) as the research for
``microfoundations for the theory of money consistent with general
equilibrium and individual optimization'' promoted by new classical
economists (Lucas, Sargent, Barro, Kydland, Prescott, etc.).

More generally, it appears that the works of new classical economists
that contributed to reshaping macroeconomics in the late 1970s and early
1980s, and that are so central in many histories of macroeconomics
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-devroey2016}{De Vroey, 2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-snowdon2005}{Snowdon and Vane, 2005}), were less
influential in Europe at the time. The articles of Lucas
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lucas1973}{1973};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lucas1972}{1972}), Sargent and Wallace
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sargent1975}{1975}) or Barro
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1976}{1976}) were constantly under-cited by
Europe-based macroeconomists in comparison to US economists in the 1970s
and 1980s (see Figure \ref{fig:plot-new-classical}).\footnote{We have to
  wait the 1982-1988 window to see some new classical contributions
  cited as much by Europeans as by US economists. The integration of
  these contributions obviously took some time in Europe and lagged
  behind the US.} This aligns with the observation that during the late
1970s and early 1980s European macroeconomists favoured an alternative
``microfoundational programme''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hoover2012}{Hoover, 2012}), namely,
disequilibrium theory (see Section \ref{disequilibrium}).

The rejection of new theoretical research in line with the search for
microfoundations and originating from the US may also be related to the
fact that European macroeconomics, as represented in the EER, tended to
be more oriented towards applied and empirical contributions.

\hypertarget{the-importance-of-applied-and-empirical-works}{%
\subsection{The importance of applied and empirical
works}\label{the-importance-of-applied-and-empirical-works}}

It is challenging to identify major trends in Europeans publications in
the EER during its initial years, as well as to observe any convergence
among European macroeconomists. Indeed, fewer papers were published in
the first issues and we may also imagine that the editorial line was
fluctuating. However, one characteristic does stand out: the inclination
to publish applied and empirical works. For instance, in the 1970s
issues, we find contributions providing empirical analysis of Dutch
pensions funds, UK income distribution, Belgium wage variations, using
principal components analysis, building indicators of capacity
utilization or larger macroeconometric models (see Table
\ref{tab:EER-empirics}).

As an emerging journal, the EER was still less likely in the mid-1970s
to publish very influential contributions. But some of the early
contributions belong to some already well established literature and
connect with two important lines of research that influenced these
contributions in the EER. \footnote{These contributions are grouped in
  topic 46 and cluster ``Modeling Consumption \& Production'', which
  partially overlap.} These two lines of research were at the juncture
of econometrics and macroeconomics.

The first one, known as the ``LSE approach'' of econometrics, was led by
David Hendry, and involved James Davidson, Grayham Mizon and Neil
Ericsson among others (\protect\hyperlink{ref-qin2013a}{Qin, 2013, chap.
4}). A major goal of the LSE approach and of Hendry was to secure
connections between the Cowles Commission structural approach of
econometrics and the Box-Jenkins time-series approach. This approach
placed significant emphasis on the search for the appropriate model
specification in order to design the best representation of the true
``data generation process''.

A significant portion of the LSE approach was dedicated to the modelling
of consumption. Davidson and Hendry, along with two co-authors, tackled
consumption modelling by inspecting the existing ``plethora of
substantially different quarterly regression equations'' and criticised
the ``proliferation of non-tested models''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-davidson1978}{Davidson et al., 1978, pp.
661--662}). This article provided an opportunity for them to highlight
the major principles of the LSE approach, notably showcasing the use of
error-correction (\protect\hyperlink{ref-qin2013a}{Qin, 2013, pp.
63--64}). During the third edition of the ISoM, published in 1981 in the
EER, they revisited the chosen equations of Davidson et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-davidson1978}{1978}) to test the integration of
the permanent income/life cycle hypothesis in Hall's -Hall
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hall1978b}{1978}) formulation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-davidson1981}{Davidson and Hendry, 1981}).

British econometric research on demand and consumption was not confined
to the LSE. Angus Deaton's and John Muellbauer's contributions also
appear to have had a significant impact on research published in the
EER. Their focus was on addressing the aggregation issue and the
limitations of a ``representative consumer'' (see Cherrier et al., this
issue). In 1980, in the \emph{American Economic Review}, they proposed a
new system of demand equations, modelling the relationship between
consumer demand, relative prices and income. They called this the
``Almost Ideal Demand System''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-deaton1980}{Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980}). They
claimed the superiority of this model to competitor such as the translog
model, or the Rotterdam model developed by Henri Theil and Anton Barten.

Research around the Rotterdam model constituted a second research
program that was central in the 1970s for European contributions
published in the EER. Theil had been appointed Professor of Econometrics
at the Netherlands School of Economics in Rotterdam in 1953, succeeding
Jan Tinbergen (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kloek2001}{Kloek, 2001}). In 1966,
he moved to Chicago, a year after publishing ``The Information Approach
to Demand Analysis'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-theil1965}{Theil, 1965}),
an essential pillar of the Rotterdam model, modelling the role played by
marginal budget shares (\protect\hyperlink{ref-clements2015a}{Clements
and Gao, 2015}). Another essential contribution was the one of Barten
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barten1964}{1964}), his Ph.D.~student in
Rotterdam (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kuleuven2016}{Leuven, 2016}).

Barten was recruited in 1966 by KU Leuven to join the newly-established
CORE. His most cited paper was the very first article published in the
EER (\protect\hyperlink{ref-barten1969}{Barten, 1969}), where Barten
developed a new estimation procedure for a system of demand equations.
The article garnered significant attention in the early years of the
EER.\footnote{Barten's work extended beyond demand equations. Along with
  other CORE economists, he developed a macroeconometric model of the
  European Economic Community (EEC), which was presented in the EER
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-barten1976}{Barten et al., 1976}). The
  following year, André Dramais from the \emph{Université Libre de
  Bruxelles} presented empirical results on inflation transmission
  between EEC members, using a competing macroeconometric model, DESMOS.
  Both models constituted crucial steps in the development of
  macroeconometric models within the European Commission (see Acosta et
  al., this issue).} The Rotterdam model recurrently appeared in EER
publications, somewhat culminating in 1984 when two synthesis articles
were devoted to it (\protect\hyperlink{ref-barnett1984}{Barnett, 1984};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-byron1984}{Byron, 1984}).

These two lines of research (the LSE approach and the Rotterdam model)
as well as the contributions of researchers gravitating around them,
appear as distinct and original compared to developments in
macroeconomics occurring on the other side of the Atlantic.\footnote{This
  is especially true for the British side, which devoted time to
  criticising many new trends in the US. For instance, Deaton and
  Muellbauer attacked the search for theoretical microfoundations to
  macroeconomics, which ignored aggregation issues (Cherrier et al.,
  this issue).} Nonetheless, we cannot that these research lines were
European specialities, as they remained primarily nationally anchored
(or only connecting Belgium and the Netherlands in the second case) and
had not yet contributing to a true process of
Europeanisation.\footnote{Some transnational connections did exist yet.
  For instance, Hendry visited the CORE during 1980-1981, at the time
  where Angus Deaton was also there
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ericsson2004}{Ericsson, 2004}). Hendry started
  to work with Jean-François Richard, a CORE econometrician, and Robert
  Engle, then at University of California San Diego. The resulting
  article developed the concept of ``strong exogeneity'' and ``super
  exogeneity'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-engle1983}{Engle et al., 1983}).}

The LSE approach and Hendry had a delayed impact on the development of
European specialities. The cointegration concept
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-engle1987}{Engle and Granger, 1987}) had some
roots in the LSE approach and in Granger's and Engle's discussion with
Hendry (\protect\hyperlink{ref-diebold2003}{Diebold, 2003, pp.
1173--1174;@qin2013a, 68}). Both the LSE approach and Granger and
Engle's contributions, as well as the work of University of Copenhagen
econometrician, Soren Johansen
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-johansen1988}{Johansen, 1988}), would deeply
influence research published by European macroeconomists in the EER
after the mid-1980s.\footnote{See Topic 46 and Community ``Business
  Cycles, Cointegration \& Trends''.} Many European macroeconomists in
the 1990s engaged in empirical research on business cycles, detrending
methods and shock identifications. Key figures in this area included the
German Horst Entorf, the Italians Marco Lippi and Lucrezia Reichlin, the
Spanish Juan José Dolado, or the LSE economist Dany Quah.\footnote{The
  French Olivier Blanchard was of course another important researcher in
  this domain, but was working in the US during the period.}

However, before this period, the true European speciality and most
unifying line of research from the 1970s to the mid-1980s was the
disequilibrium theory.

\hypertarget{disequilibrium}{%
\subsection{Disequilibrium theory as a landmark for European
macroeconomics}\label{disequilibrium}}

Research around the disequilibrium theory represents a significant yet
often overlooked milestone in the history of macroeconomics
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-backhouseboianovski2013}{Backhouse and
Boianovsky, 2013}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-plassard2021}{Plassard et al.,
2021}). It played a crucial role in the 1970s in rekindling interest in
the research finding appropriate microfoundations for macroeconomics in
the 1970s.\footnote{See Duarte and Lima
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-duartelima2012a}{2012}) for a history of
  microfoundations in macroeconomics.} Rooted in the tradition of the
general equilibrium theory and influenced by the work of Patinkin,
Clower and Leijonhufvud, disequilibrium theory investigated the effects
of non-walrasian price-setting (i.e.~without \emph{tâtonnement}),
fixed-price and quantity rationing on macroeconomic outcomes. This
approach provided an alternative to the new classical contributions and
the Lucas and Sargent's ``representative-agent microfoundational
program'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hoover2012}{Hoover, 2012}), which many
proponents of disequilibrium research explicitly rejected
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-renault2020a}{Renault, 2020}). Although Barro
and Grossman's (\protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1971}{1971}) article helped
popularising disequilibrium macroeconomics, this research line was
deeply anchored in France and Belgium, and it continued to expand
throughout the 1970s and 1980s (Plassard and Renault, this issue).

Bibliometric analysis reveals that the ``Disequilibrium and Keynesian
economics'' cluster constituted the most significant cluster closely
associated with the EER and fostered by Europe-based economists. This
cluster also encompasses other ``alternative research lines'' to Lucas
and Sargent's research program (\protect\hyperlink{ref-devroey2016}{De
Vroey, 2016, chap. 14}), such as Azariadis's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-azariadis1975}{1975}) implicit contract model,
Hart's (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hart1982}{1982}) imperfect competition
model or Diamond's (\protect\hyperlink{ref-diamond1982}{1982}) search
model. This testifies that in the late 1970s and in the 1980s,
connections existed between US and European macroeconomists regarding
the renewal of theoretical macroeconomics and the search for
microfoundations, as well as the opposition to new classical
macroeconomics. \footnote{As a complement, topic modelling demonstrates
  the extent to which disequilibrium theory pervaded European
  macroeconomics in the 1980s, unifying the treatment of diverse
  macroeconomic issues (see notably Topic 25, Topic 39, and Topic 11.}

First of all, part of the literature ``arose out of the internal
problems within general equilibrium theory''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-backhouseboianovski2013}{Backhouse and
Boianovsky, 2013, p. 105}), notably the need to break with
\emph{tâtonnement} and to build general equilibrium model with agents
setting prices in the model. Disequilibrium macroeconomics thus
contributed to the persistence of a lively research program centred on
general equilibrium theory issues.\footnote{See topic 11.} Moreover,
disequilibrium macroeconomics also emerged as a pivotal framework for
accounting for the 1970s stagflation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-backhouseboianovski2013}{Backhouse and
Boianovsky, 2013, chap. 8}). Malinvaud's \emph{Theory of Unemployment
Reconsidered} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-malinvaud1977}{1977}) marked a
decisive development in this direction by opposing ``Keynesian
unemployment'', which resulted from excess supply in both goods and
labour markets, and ``classical unemployment'', caused by excess demand
for goods but excess supply in the labour market---implying excessively
high real wages.\footnote{Malinvaud
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-malinvaud1977}{1977}) proposed a third regime,
  ``repressed inflation'', resulting from excess demand on both markets.}
The 1973 oil shock and the concurrent decline in productivity would
explain the rise of a classical unemployment in the 1970s. Consequently,
the primary concern for proponents of the three-regime approach became
determining the extent to which European unemployment could be
attributed to either Keynesian or classical unemployment.

This framework for understanding unemployment and stagflation was
featured, discussed, or at least mentioned in numerous influential works
in European macroeconomics in the 1980s.\footnote{``Influential'' means
  here highly cited by European economists in one or several clusters or
  topics.} In the EER, Drèze and Modigliani examined the ``current state
of underemployment in Belgium'' by analysing the trade off between real
wages and employment in the context of a small open economy
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dreze1981}{Drèze and Modigliani, 1981, p. 2}).
They combined the possibility of classical unemployment, inspired by
Malinvaud (\protect\hyperlink{ref-malinvaud1977}{1977}), with Modigliani
and Padoa-Schioppa's argument that, ``in an open economy, external
balance implies a constraining relationship between the levels of real
wages and employment'' (\emph{ibid.}). In the early 1980s, Malinvaud's
framework was also connected to the reccurring EER debate surrounding
the ``wage gap''. Question was to determine whether real wages were too
high (indicating a positive wage gap). Bruno and Sachs were central
figures in this debate and explicitly relied on Malinvaud's
framework.\footnote{Bruno and Sachs's
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-brunosachs1985}{1985}) book, \emph{Economics
  of Worldwide Stagflation}, provided a synthesis of their late 1970s
  and early 1980s works, and served as a highly cited resource for
  European macroeconomists in the 1980s (see also
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-goutsmedt2021}{Goutsmedt et al., 2021, sec.
  3}).}

Outside of unemployment and stagflation, disequilibrium theory was also
extended to other macroeconomic issues. For instance, Avinash Dixit,
when at University of Warwick, extended Clower's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-clower1965}{1965}) dual decision hypothesis and
Malinvaud's framework to international trade theory
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dixit1978}{Dixit, 1978, p. 393}). According to
Dixit, this provided the foundation for a ``more satisfactory model of
the balance of trade'' than Frenkel and Johnson's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-frenkel1976}{1976}) monetary approach, which
``assumes instantaneous attainment of Walrasian equilibrium in commodity
and labour markets'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-dixit1978}{Dixit, 1978, p.
393}). Dixit's model would later form the basis for parts of his joint
book with Victor Norman, from the Norwegian School of Economics and
Business Administration, on the \emph{Theory of International Trade}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dixit1980}{Dixit and Norman, 1980}). The book
representend a pivotal reference for European economists working on
international trade.\footnote{See topic 39.}

This centrality of disequilibrium macroeconomics in European
macroeconomics is also evident in the extent that European
macroeconomists had to position themselves relative to it, particularly
to the Keynesian versus classical unemployment framework. In May 1985
was held a conference in Sussex about European unemployment, published
in \emph{Economica} the next year.\footnote{On this episode, see
  Backhouse, Forder and Laskaridis, as well as Plassard and Renault,
  both in this issue.} Macroeconomists from different countries
presented their analyses of European national unemployment rates. While
Sneessens and Drèze estimated a ``two-market macroeconomic rationing (or
disequilibirum) model of the economy''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-sneessens1986}{Sneessens and Drèze, 1986, p.
S97}), Malinvaud (\protect\hyperlink{ref-malinvaud1986}{1986}) proposed
a more descriptive analysis to explain the rise of unemployment in
France, although he acknowledged proximities with Sneessens and Drèze
formalisation in the same issue. Malinvaud discussed determinants of
``the classical component of unemployment''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-malinvaud1986}{Malinvaud, 1986, p. S216}), but
also criticised the use of Phillips curve with a non-accelerating
inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) to account for the causes of
unemployment. In contrast, NAIRU was central to the model proposed by
Layard and Nickell to discuss British unemployment. They argued that the
``labour demand function that {[}they{]} use cuts through the fruitless
debate now raging (especially in Europe) as to whether current
unemployment is `classical' or `Keynesian'\,''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-layard1986}{Layard and Nickell, 1986, p. S121}).

While not completely consensual, disequilibrium theory and the
classical/Keynesian unemployment distinction were unavoidable in the
mid-1980s. They shaped the treatment of various macroeconomic issues
such as international trade, inflation, unemployment, wage-setting, and
spurred new theoretical developments, refinements existing models, as
well as econometric innovations
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-renault2019}{Renault, 2022b}). Furthermore, this
line of research was embraced by macroeconomists across various European
countries and fostered transnational collaborations. In line with the
broader disregard or rejection of new trends in US macroeconomics by
many Europe-based macroeconomists (Section \ref{opposition-trends}),
disequilibrium macroeconomics brought forward an alternative theoretical
framework to new classical macroeconomics that was emerging in the US
during the same period.

\hypertarget{period2}{%
\section{The Mid-1980s to the Late 1990s: Remaining Specialities despite
Theoretical Convergence}\label{period2}}

The relationship of European macroeconomics with its US counterpart, as
well as its connection to new classical economics, gradually transformed
after the mid-1980s. This shift was likely due to the dwindling dynamism
of research surrounding disequilibrium theory. In the late 1980s,
disequilibrium theory had lost its ability to build bridges between
European macroeconomists and no longer served as a unifying theoretical
language. Instead, what brought European macroeconomists together in the
1990s was not a common theoretical framework, but rather distinctly
European matters (such as high unemployment or European integration), as
well as a new approach to address many macroeconomic issues: political
economy. This later trend served as the belated entry point for new
classical economics to eventually influence European macroeconomics, and
this was achieved not through Lucas and Sargent's works, or through the
Real Business Cycles models, but through the time consistency literature
based on the contributions of Kydland, Prescott and Barro.

\hypertarget{disequilibrium-fall}{%
\subsection{The Fall of Disequilibrium}\label{disequilibrium-fall}}

After the mid-1980s, publications about disequilibrium continued to pop
out occasionally in the EER. But in quantitative terms, we observe a
decrease of disequilibrium importance both through the bibliometric and
topic modelling analyses.\footnote{See the destiny of the disequilibrium
  cluster and of topic 11 in the summary figures in the two online
  appendices.} We can also observe that indirectly in topic 25 on real
wages and employment: while Malinvaud
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-malinvaud1977}{1977}) was an important reference
for the older articles of the topic, it disappeared from the
bibliography of the most recent articles. Part of the research program
on disequilibrium seems to have persisted in the 1990s through its most
theoretical part and developed closer links with the literature on
coordination and sunspots.\footnote{Many articles of the Disequilibrium
  cluster are to be found in the cluster ``Coordination \& Sunspots 2''
  after the disappearance of the former (see the summary flow chart in
  the Bibliographic coupling online appendix). The cluster
  ``Coordination \& Sunspots 2'' was only slightly over-represented by
  European economists, but gathered articles mainly published in the Top
  5.}

The decline of the disequilibrium program can also be observed in the
diminishing prominence of the Keynesian/classical unemployment
distinction. For instance, we observe that when using the
insider-outsider opposition to discuss European unemployment in 1987,
Nils Gottfries and Henrik Horn still referred to the Keynesian/classical
opposition and argued in their paper that ``the present unemployment may
originally have arisen for Keynesian reasons, but once unemployment is
created it will change the conditions under which wages are formed, thus
persisting in a classical form''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gottfries1987}{Gottfries and Horn, 1987, p.
2}).\footnote{See Section \ref{unemployment} below for analyses on the
  various treatments of the unemployment issue by European
  macroeconomists.} Similarly, Assar Lindbeck and Denis Snower cited
Malinvaud (\protect\hyperlink{ref-malinvaud1977}{1977}) and the
``boundary between the `Keynesian' and `Classical' regimes''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lindbeck1987a}{Lindbeck and Snower, 1987, p.
408}). This reference to Malinvaud's framework disappear in the
following years in similar works (as in
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gottfries1992}{Gottfries, 1992}, for instance).
More generally, the reference to the classical versus Keynesian
unemployment was most of the time missing in the large literature that
developed after the mid-1980s to understand the problem of large
unemployment in Europe.

\hypertarget{unemployment}{%
\subsection{New Approaches to Explain European
Unemployment}\label{unemployment}}

After the mid-1980s, unemployment became a significant area of research
for European macroeconomists and the EER published multitude of articles
on the subject.\footnote{See Topic 37 and Community ``Theory of
  Unemployment and Job Dynamics''} Following the stagflation and the
subsequent disinflation of the early 1980s, unemployment rose to rare
quasi unprecedented levels in European countries. However, unlike the US
where unemployment eventually returned to levels comparable to those of
the early 1970s, European unemployment remained high even after
inflation stabilised. This macroeconomic situation was coined the
``Eurosclerosis'', presenting a new puzzle for macroeconomists to solve.

The Eurosclerosis puzzle was the starting point for numerous
contributions by Europe-based economists. It fostered the
Europeanisation of macroeconomics by encouraging comparisons between
European countries in order to identify common features that would
explain European high unemployment. This process was facilitated notably
through the organisation of conferences and special issues, like the May
1985 conference in Sussex, published in \emph{Economica} the next year
(Backhouse et al., this issue). Macroeconomists also proposed empirical
studies using data from various OECD countries to understand the
peculiarities of the European context. These collaborative efforts and
comparative analyses contributed to the development of a more unified
European macroeconomic research community.

Such comparison of OECD countries were developed in Bruno and Sachs'
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-brunosachs1985}{1985}) book, which analysed the
differences in terms of nominal and real wage rigidities between the US
and Europe. They argued that the higher unemployment cost of stagflation
in Europe was the result of larger real rigidities. Bruno and Sachs's
approach to the unemployment issue, developed in a series of articles
since 1979 and culminating in their book, remained influential for
European economists during the 1980s.

Their work constituted a point of departure for another important line
of research developed by LSE economists Richard Layard, Richard Jackman,
Stephen Nickell, and their various co-authors. In a conference held in
Cambridge in July 1981, Grubb et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-grubb1982}{1982}) proposed an explanation of the
``Causes of the Current Stagflation'' through a comparison of 19 OECD
countries (see also Backhouse et al., this issue). They argued that high
real wages in Europe were ``a consequence rather than a prime cause of
the difficulty'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-grubb1982}{Grubb et al., 1982,
p. 707}). High real wages were the symptom of a rise in the NAIRU,
caused by an increase in the relative prices of raw materials and a
sharp fall in the rate of productivity growth. Grubb, Jackman and Layard
pursued this analysis of real and nominal rigidities in OECD countries
the next year during the ISoM in Mannheim, in a paper later published in
the EER (\protect\hyperlink{ref-grubb1983a}{Grubb et al., 1983}). Over
the course of a decade, the LSE team produced a series of articles
exploring various specifications and estimations of European
unemployment determinants. This research culminated in 1991 with Layard,
Nickell and Jackman's book, ``Unemployment: Macroeconomic Performance
and the Labour Market''. The book provided an extensive analysis of
unemployment in the OECD, relying on a theoretical framework of
inflation dynamics and wage bargaining
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-layard1991a}{Layard et al., 1991}). Three years
later, Charles Bean, also at the LSE and who had collaborated with
Layard and Nickell on several occasions, published two surveys in the
\emph{Journal of Economic Literature} and the EER about the treatment of
European unemployment (\protect\hyperlink{ref-bean1994}{Bean, 1994a},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-bean1994a}{1994b}).

Beyond comparing macroeconomic data of different European countries,
European macroeconomists began also to focus on institutional
comparisons to better understand the differences in wage bargaining
organisation, labor market regulations and other factors across European
countries. In this regard, Lars Calmfors (University of Stockholm) and
John Driffil's (University of Southampton) analysis of European
countries corporatism constituted a key study cited in EER articles
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-calmfors1988}{Calmfors and Driffill, 1988}).
They estimated the impact on wages and unemployment of various measures
of corporatism provided by economists or political scientists. Calmfors
and Driffil argued that countries with low centralisation of wage
bargaining (like the US) and high centralisation (the Nordic Countries)
performed better in terms of employment than those with medium
centralisation (most countries of the European Community at the time).

Another institutional approach that gained popularity in Europe was the
insider-outsider perspective. The approach was developed Nils Gottfries,
Henrik Horn, Assar Lindbeck (all from the University of Stockholm), in
collaboration with Denis Snower from Birkbeck College
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gottfries1992}{Gottfries, 1992};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-gottfries1987}{Gottfries and Horn, 1987};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lindbeck1987a}{Lindbeck and Snower, 1987},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lindbeck1986}{1986}). The insider-outsider
literature posited that insiders (the employed or unionised workers)
have the upper-hand in wage-setting. Employment being determined in
function of wages, higher wages could maintain outsiders outside of the
labour market. In the context of Europe after the stagflation, this
means that an increase in labour demand might result in rising wages
without a corresponding increase in employment.

The interest in explaining high European unemployment extended beyond
the contributions of UK and Swedish macroeconomists. Another influential
research path was developed by the Spanish Samuel Bentolila and the
French Gilles Saint-Paul (EHESS), in collaboration with Giuseppe Bertola
from Princeton (\protect\hyperlink{ref-bentolila1990}{Bentolila and
Bertola, 1990}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-bentolila1992a}{Bentolila and
Saint-Paul, 1992}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-bertola1990a}{Bertola, 1990}).
They produced a series of articles examining the role of job security
and firing costs in the stock of unemployment and its variation.

All these lines of research were central for European macroeconomists
publishing in the EER, as well as they constituted a true specificity in
comparison to the US. They spread across European countries and fostered
transnational collaborations, even if the UK emerged as a more dynamic
producer of contributions on European unemployment. Another influential
approach, also partly centred in the UK and the LSE, was stemming from
search and matching models, developed by Dale Mortensen from
Northwestern University and Christopher Pissarides from the LSE
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mortensen1994}{Mortensen and Pissarides, 1994}).
Mortensen and Pissarides' theoretical framework contributed to shape the
orientation of the research agenda in Europe, whether on job flows,
firing costs, skills and geographical mismatching. However, this
approach also found resonance among US macroeconomists and Top 5
journals, and so does not exclusively belong to European macroeconomics.

\hypertarget{political-economics}{%
\subsection{A New Unifying Language: Political
Economy}\label{political-economics}}

European macroeconomists' research in the 1980s and 1990s was largely
shaped by pressing macroeconomic issues of the period, such as European
high rates of unemployment or the challenges presented by the European
integration (fiscal convergence, monetary union, etc.). Beyond examining
these specific objects, many European macroeconomists also adopted a
specific perspective on these problems by utilising a political economy
framework.

Political economy, which encompasses various research lines that emerged
in the 1970s, can be understood as the application of modern economic
analysis techniques (such optimisation or game theory) to examine the
impact of politics on economics.\footnote{For a history of the emergence
  of the ``new political economy'' or ``new political macroeconomics''
  label, see Galvão de~Almeida
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-galvaodealmeida2021}{2021}).} As Allan Drazen
defined it in his 2000 handbook, \emph{Political Economy in
Macroeconomics}, the ``new political economy'' focused on understanding
``how political constraints may explain the choice of policies (and thus
economic outcomes) that differ from optimal policies''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-drazen2002}{Drazen, 2002, p. 7}). In Europe,
Torsten Persson and Guido Tabellini
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-persson2002}{2002}) provided a detailed
introduction to recent research in political economy.\footnote{Torsten
  Persson obtained his PhD in 1982 at the Institute for International
  Economic Studies in Stockholm under the supervision of Lars Svensson
  and became professor in Stockholm in 1987. Tabellini graduated from
  Torino before moving to UCLA for his PhD. After an initial position at
  Stanford, he returned to Italy in 1990.} They advocated for a vision
of ``political \emph{economics}'' as connected to the ``macroeconomic
tradition'', by adopting ``a general equilibrium approach'' and seeking
``explicit microfoundations''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-persson2002}{Persson and Tabellini, 2002, p.
3}).\footnote{They used the term ``political economics'' rather than
  ``political economy'' to avoid a supposed association with ``an
  alternative analytical approach, as if the traditional tools of
  analysis in economics were not appropriate to study political
  phenomena'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-persson2002}{Persson and
  Tabellini, 2002, p. 2}).} They traced ``political economics'' back to
three traditions (p.~2): \emph{(i)} ``the theory of macroeconomic
policy'' inspired by Lucas, which focused on the impact of policy
decisions on macroeconomic variables; \emph{(ii)} the public choice
tradition of James Buchanan, Gordon Tullock and Mancur Olson, which
applied economic theories to analyse political decision-making
processes; and \emph{(iii)} the formal analysis in political analysis,
inspired by Riker, that employs mathematical models especially to study
voting and decision-making processes.

That is this first tradition that lies at the core of European
macroeconomics in the 1990s. The integration of rational expectations in
the 1970s had highlight specific policy problems. The most emblematic
example is the time-consistency problem popularized by Kydland and
Prescott (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kydland1977}{1977}). The basic idea is
that the optimal policy at time \emph{t} differs from the optimal policy
at time \emph{t + s}, because policymakers have an interest to deceive
economic agents for the very benefit of these same agents. If agents are
rational, they will anticipate policymakers incentive, rendering the
optimal policy unattainable. The article thus prompted the question of
whether it is necessary to ``tie the hands'' of policymakers, leading to
numerous extensions, especially regarding central banks and the concepts
of credibility and reputation (\protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1983}{Barro
and Gordon, 1983a}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1983c}{1983b}), or the
selection of central bankers as well as the formalisation of delegation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rogoff1985b}{Rogoff, 1985}). This literature
traces its origins to the US academic debates surrounding rational
expectations and the efficiency of macroeconomic policies in the 1970s
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hoover1988}{Hoover, 1988, pp. 80--86}). However,
the articles cited above experiences an unusual citation trajectory:
after an initial surge of popularity and subsequent decline (as is
common for many influential articles), they saw a resurgence of
popularity in the 1990s (Figure \ref{fig:plot-political-economy}). This
renewed interest can be attributed to European macroeconomists who
increasingly cited these references more than their US counterparts
(Figure \ref{fig:plot-political-economy-europe}). Prominent European
macroeconomists, such as Persson, Svensson, and Horn in Sweden, Daniel
Cohen in France, Dolado in Spain, or Francesco Giavazzi and Tabellini in
Italy, played a significant role in revitalising these ideas in the
context of European macroeconomic issues.\footnote{Italian economists
  were overly represented in this line of research, not only in Europe
  but also in the US, the most famous example being Alberto Alesina.}

\begin{figure}[H]

}

\caption{Share of articles citing political economy literature (5-year moving average)}\label{fig:plot-political-economy}
\end{figure}

This interest of European economists for the new political economy
literature of the late 1970s and early 1980s is confirmed by both
bibliometric and topic modelling analyses. The fundamental references
cited above constitute the most cited references in the EER and by
European macroeconomists in various clusters and topics.\footnote{See
  the cluster ``Political Economics of Central Banks'' and the topic 8
  on credibility, optimal policy and policy rule. Beyond these very
  ``European'' cluster and topic, the examination of other topics allow
  us to observe that the new political economy literature infused many
  subjects in the 1990s. In many prevalent topics in the 1990s, the
  difference in the references cited by Europe-based and US-based
  economists is explained by the fact that Europeans refer more to
  political economy contributions (see Topic 3, 20, 22 and 36).} Through
the EER and Top 5 journals, we can distinguish three areas where
European macroeconomists employed a political economy framework in the
1990S, setting European macroeconomics apart from its US
counterpart.\footnote{The interest for political economy in the EER may
  have been encouraged by the fact that many economists advocating this
  line of research such as Pagano, Personn, Drazen, Giavazzi or Alesina
  were associate editors or editors of the EER in the 1990s.
  Nonetheless, this inclination of Europe-based macroeconomists for
  political economy is not limited to the EER, as a similar trend was
  observable in the Top 5 journals.}

First, many discussions regarding the appropriate framework for monetary
policy incorporated political economy contributions. Giavazzi and Marco
Pagano's (\protect\hyperlink{ref-giavazzi1988}{1988}) EER article
represented a notable contribution in this line of research. The authors
examined the advantages of adhering to the European monetary system
(EMS) for countries with higher inflation rates. They explored the idea
that the EMS could serve as a a solution to the time-consistency
problem, by ``tying the hands'' of high-inflation countries. Forced to
maintain a stable exchange rate, these countries would face reduced
incentives to generate surprise inflation, thus increasing the
credibility of their monetary authorities. The adherence to the EMS, as
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-giavazzi1988}{Giavazzi and Pagano, 1988, p.
1057}) argues, ``parallels that in Rogoff
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rogoff1985b}{1985}), who shows that the
non-cooperative rate of inflation can be reduced `through a system of
rewards and punishments which alters the incentives of the central
bank'\,''. The remaining question was whether EMS adhesion would be
``welfare-improving'' for high-inflation countries
(\emph{ibid.}).\footnote{Giavazzi and Pagano's article constitutes a
  major reference for topics 3 and 8.} Still in the EER, Daniel Laskar
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-laskar1989}{1989}) also built upon Rogoff's
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rogoff1985b}{1985}) argument that appointing a
conservative central banker could benefit society. He extended the issue
to a two-country model to discuss cases in which appointing conservative
central bankers in both countries could be either detrimental or
beneficial to both.\footnote{We also observe another important approach
  to the EMS issue, which is more empirical and somewhat less framed in
  political economy terms, but still deals with ``credibility'': the
  expectations of exiting the EMS and the credibility associated with
  certain exchange rates in a target zone regime
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-rose1994}{Rose and Svensson, 1994};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-svensson1993a}{Svensson, 1993}).}

Still on monetary policy, the monetary union issue also stimulated
political economy contributions. In his EER survey about the theoretical
justification for the convergence requirements of the Maastricht treaty,
Paul De Grauwe (KU Leuven) distinguished between two types of
justification: \emph{(i)} ``the traditional theory of optimum currency
areas (OCA)'' and \emph{(ii)} ``the more recent `new view' based on
credibility issues'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-degrauwe1996}{De Grauwe,
1996, pp. 1091--1092}). Unlike the OCA theory, the second approach
relied on the intuition of the Barro-Gordon model, analysing ``how
countries can gain (or loose) credibility by joining a monetary union''
and thus how inflation rates would converge.\footnote{The OCA theory, on
  the other hand, focused on the divergence in output and employment
  trends.} Looking at citation patterns, it appears that European
macroeconomists favoured the credibility approach over the OCA theory
appeared.\footnote{In topic 3 on the monetary union, both Europe-based
  authors and EER articles refer more to the Barro-Gordon model or to
  Giavazzi and Pagano (\protect\hyperlink{ref-giavazzi1988}{1988}) than
  to Mundell's and McKinnon's pioneering contributions on the OCA.}

A second area where the political economy framework was influential is
the issue of wage-setting.\footnote{See topics 3 (on monetary union), 6
  (on exchange rate dynamics), 25 (on real wages, employment and
  contracts) and 8 (on strategic policy making issues).} In the EER,
Horn and Persson (\protect\hyperlink{ref-horn1988}{1988}) investigated
the interaction between exchange rate policy and the role of unions in
wage-setting. If devaluations intended to maintain or increase
competitiveness are followed by compensatory wage increases, the effects
on competitiveness are cancelled, and the economy faces a
``devaluation-wage spiral'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-horn1988}{Horn and
Persson, 1988, p. 1621}). The authors' starting point is that ``if wage
setters are rational and forward-looking and understand the objectives
behind the government's exchange rate policy (\ldots) they will
anticipate exchange rate changes and take them into account in their
wage decisions'' (p.~1622). Their goal was thus to endogenise both wage
decisions and policy formation within a game-theoretic framework.

Thorvadur Gylfasson and Lindbeck's similar work on the links between
wage-setting and monetary policy is enlightening on the transformations
of European macroeconomics after the mid-1980s. In a 1984 article in the
EER, they integrated together cost push and demand pull inflation in a
Keynesian framework, considering the behaviour of aggregate supply and
the Phillips curve for wage formation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gylfason1984}{Gylfason and Lindbeck, 1984}). As
they acknowledged themselves, the issues raised by their model echoed
Malinvaud's (\protect\hyperlink{ref-malinvaud1977}{1977}) opposition
between Classical and Keynesian unemployment
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gylfason1984}{Gylfason and Lindbeck, 1984, pp.
6--7}). Their article had a political economy flavour as they dealt with
``competing wage claims'' and framed their model as a duopoly problem
\emph{à la} Cournot. In their subsequent article in the EER, they relied
explicitly on game theory to deal with the interaction of wages
determination and government spending
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gylfason1986}{Gylfason and Lindbeck, 1986}).
Years later, revisiting the issue of wage setting and monetary policy,
Gylfason and Lindbeck referred to the ``wage gaps'' debate of the 1970s
and the ``cases where government efforts to reduce unemployment by
bringing real wages down through price inflation were frustrated by
subsequent nominal wage increases''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gylfason1994}{Gylfason and Lindbeck, 1994, p.
34}). However, they made no reference to classical and Keynesian
unemployment. They proposed a model in which wages are determined
``through collective bargaining among strong and well coordinated labor
unions'' (34) and explored its consequences for monetary policy using a
game-theoretic model similar to (\protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1983}{Barro
and Gordon, 1983a}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1983c}{1983b}). To some
extent, the trajectory of Gylfason and Lindbeck's work is representative
of the transformation of European macroeconomics between the 1970s and
the 1990s, as observed through the EER.

A third area concerns fiscal policy and European integration. Alberto
Alesina, Tabellini and Persson advocated for the development of a
``positive theory'' of fiscal policy in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Alesian and Tabellini explained in the AER that their goal was to
``{[}abandon{]} the assumption that fiscal policy is set by a benevolent
social planner who maximizes the welfare of a representative consumer
\ldots{} {[}for{]} an economy with two policymakers with different
objectives alternating in office as a result of elections''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-alesina1990}{Alesina and Tabellini, 1990}).
Persson and Tabellini (\protect\hyperlink{ref-persson1992}{1992})
defended a similar ``positive public finance'' research agenda. Their
objective was to understand how the rising European integration and the
removal of barriers to the mobility of capital, goods and labour could
affect the ``politico-economic equilibrium that determines fiscal
policy'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-persson1992}{Persson and Tabellini,
1992, p. 689}).\footnote{There references were important for
  Europe-based economists, in comparison to US-based economists, in
  Topic 36, in comparison to US-based economists}.

As the three examples above demonstrate, after the mid-1980s, (new)
political economy and its pioneering works
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1983}{Barro and Gordon, 1983a},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1983c}{1983b};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kydland1977}{Kydland and Prescott, 1977};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rogoff1985b}{Rogoff, 1985}) provided a unifying
framework for numerous European macroeconomists for addressing
macroeconomic challenges such as the European integration and the
construction of a European monetary system.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conclusion}

This article presents an overview of the evolution of European
specificities in macroeconomics in comparison to the US since the 1970s.
Naturally, this overview warrants further research and should not be
over-generalised. Indeed,the analysis is focused solely on the Top 5
journals and the EER. While this comparison may provide a reasonable
representation of the differences between the US and Europe in
mainstream macroeconomics, some biases may exist, especially during the
initial years of our studied period when the Top 5 were not yet
perceived as the ``Top 5'', and the EER was a relatively young journal.

Neither is our study exhaustive: due to time and space constraints, we
were unable to explore in detail all the clusters and topics, and we had
to focus on what seemed to us the most significant ones.\footnote{For
  instance, we left aside topics and clusters related to international
  macroeconomics, even if we occasionally mentioned some relevant
  articles. This is also because, while international macroeconomics
  topics and clusters are heavily associated with the EER, there is no
  over-representation of Europe-based economists in them. We also
  exclude from analysis topics and clusters that were too small or had
  low prevalence, as well as those that seemed too far from
  macroeconomics---this latter issue being a consequence of the
  different JEL code classification before 1991.} Moreover, even when we
have devoted our attention to some distinctly European lines of
research, a more ``micro'' exploration may still be necessary to
understand their specificity and their emergence as a proper European
speciality.

Despite its limitations, our study offers valuable insights about the
history of European macroeconomics, revealing important and enduring
difference from its US counterpart. In the fact of internationalisation
and standardisation of economics since the 1970s, European
macroeconomics has managed to retain distinctive features throughout the
1970s to 1990s. These features were of different nature and two periods
may be distinguished.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, European macroeconomics maintained
its distance to the US debates, which were driven by the emergence of
rational expectations and the contributions of new classical economists.
The question of microfoundations, which became pivotal in the US, was
not entirely disregarded by European macroeconomists. However, an
alternative to the new classical microfoundational programme surfaced
and contributed to foster transnational collaborations: disequilibrium
theory. This theoretical perspective constituted a significant part of
the research undertaken by European macroeconomists, extending beyond
general equilibrium theory and offering a unifying framework for
addressing various macroeconomic issues (unemployment, stagflation,
stabilization policies, international trade, etc.). Although the
importance of disequilibrium theory has been acknowledged in recent
historiography of macroeconomics (see also Renault and Plassard, this
issue), our analysis outlines the dissemination and life cycle of
disequilibrium macroeconomics.

Indeed, after the mid-1980s, the disequilibrium line of research waned.
Concurrently, new classical economists' contributions began to find
success in Europe: not so much through the adoption Real Business Cycle
models, which remained relatively uncommon, but rather through the
influence of the new political economy literature of Kydland and
Prescott (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kydland1977}{1977}) and
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1983}{Barro and Gordon, 1983a},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-barro1983c}{1983b}). In the 1990s, European
macroeconomics seemed more aligned with its US counterpart in terms of
theoretical and methodological approaches.

However, this does not imply an absence of differences: European
macroeconomists specialised in subjects that were only occasionally
tackled, if at all, by their US colleagues. The distinct macroeconomic
situation of European economies (particularly regarding unemployment),
the issue of economic interdependence among them, and the construction
of the European union likely pushed European economists towards
different avenues. The prominence of political economy in European
macroeconomics in the 1990s probably reflects these distinct incentives
for European researchers.

\hypertarget{corpus}{%
\subsubsection*{B.1. Corpus Creation}\label{corpus}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{B.1. Corpus Creation}

For the present study we used two different corpora. The first corpus is
composed of all EER articles and allows us to track how publications,
citations, references and authors affiliations evolved since the
creation of the journal in 1969 up to 2002. The second corpus is
composed of all macroeconomic articles published in the top five
economics journals (\emph{American Economic Review}, \emph{Journal of
Political Economy}, \emph{Econometrica}, \emph{Quarterly Journal of
Economics}, \emph{Review of Economic Studies}) and the EER.
Macroeconomic articles are identified thanks to the former and new
classification of the JEL codes (\protect\hyperlink{ref-jel1991}{JEL,
1991}).\footnote{See \ref{eer-top5-macro} for the list of JEL codes
  used.} This corpus is used as the basis for topic modelling and
bibliographic coupling analysis to contrast macroeconomics publications
authored by Europe-based and US-based authors, and/or published in top 5
journals and in the EER.

\hypertarget{eer-publications}{%
\paragraph*{EER Publications}\label{eer-publications}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{EER Publications}

For the creation of the first corpus composed of all EER articles, we
used a mix of \emph{Web of Science} (WoS) and \emph{Scopus}. While WoS
has all articles of the EER between 1969-1970 and 1974-2002, it is
missing most articles published between 1971 and 1973. To make up for
the missing data, we use Scopus to complete the dataset. This operation
required normalization of the Scopus dataset, and manual cleaning of
variables that were missing from Scopus compared to WoS. This mostly
includes cleaning the references to match \emph{Scopus} references with
WoS ones, and identification of author's affiliation.

\hypertarget{eer-top5-macro}{%

The construction of this corpus is made in multiple steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Identifying macroeconomics articles
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We identified all articles published in macroeconomics using JEL codes
  related to macroeconomics (we get JEL codes of Top 5 and EER articles
  thanks to the Econlit database). We consider that an article is a
  macroeconomics article if it has one of the following codes:
\item
  For old JEL codes (pre-1991): 023, 131, 132, 133, 134, 223, 311, 313,
  321, 431, 813, 824.
\item
  For new JEL codes (1991 onward): all E, F3 and F4.\footnote{The new
    classification has a clear categorisation of Macroeconomics (the
    letter `E'), but we had F3 and F4 as they deal with international
    macroeconomics. For the older JEL codes, we use the table of
    correspondence produce by the \emph{Journal of Economic Literature}
    itself (\protect\hyperlink{ref-jel1991}{JEL, 1991}).}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Using these JEL codes, we match econlit articles with WoS articles
  using the following matching variables:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Journal, Volume, First Page
\item
  Year, Journal, First Page, Last Page
\item
  Year, Volume, First Page, Last Page
\item
  First Author, Year, Volume, First Page
\item
  First Author, Title, Year
\item
  Title, Year, First Page
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  We then kept articles published in the EER (Corpus 1 improved with
  Scopus), and in the top five journals between 1973 and 2002. Out of
  the 3592 articles in econlit, we matched 3428. \footnote{Most of the
    unmatched articles are not `articles' properly speaking: they often
    are reply and comments on other published articles.}
\item
  Finally, we were able to collect abstracts:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  using \emph{Scopus} for the EER. All abstracts have been matched with
  the EER corpus.
\item
  using \emph{Microsoft Academics} to collect the highest number of
  available abstracts for the Top 5 as too many abstracts were missing
  in WoS or \emph{Scopus}. The abstracts extracted from this database
  are matched with our WoS Top 5 corpus using
\end{itemize}

Moreover, given that the size of our corpus is modest, we made an
extensive semi-automatic cleaning of references to improve references
identification by adding the most commonly cited books, book chapter,
and articles that are not otherwise identified in WoS when possible.

\hypertarget{b.2.-variable-creation}{%
\subsubsection*{B.2. Variable creation}\label{b.2.-variable-creation}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{B.2. Variable creation}

\hypertarget{author-affiliation}{%
\paragraph*{Authors' affiliation}\label{author-affiliation}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Authors' affiliation}

Authors' affiliations information were extracted from WoS. However, the
affiliations are not per author, but instead per institutional
departments per paper. For example, in the case of an article with two
authors from the same department, the department (and institution or
country associated with it) is only counted once. Similarly, a
single-authored article where the author has three affiliations can
result in one article having three affiliations. While in some cases we
can inferred the institutional affiliation for each author (e.g., one
institution, multiple authors), in others we cannot (e.g., two
institutions, three authors). For example, in an article with two
authors from Princeton and one author from Stanford, we only know that
the article was written by at least one author from Princeton and at
least one from Stanford, but not that the individual ratio was two
third.

For the descriptive analysis we simply use the count of unique
combinations of institution and country per article, and use occurrences
as an approximation of affiliation. However, for the more detailed
network and topic analysis, we restructured the information. given that
we are mostly interested in the relationship between Europe and US
economics, we simply looked at the share of papers authored by
Europe-based and US-based economists. While we do not have individual
affiliation, we know with certainty when a paper has only European
authors, only American authors, or a mix of the two. For this reason,
while the share of institutions within the corpus is only an estimation
based on the occurrences of affiliation, the information generated to
identify US authored papers and European authored paper is certain.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{B.3. Bibliographic Coupling and
Cluster Detection}

\hypertarget{main-index}{%
\paragraph*{Main Index}\label{main-index}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Main Index}

A first way to identify potential differences between European and
American macroeconomics is to find articles written by Europeans and
published in a European journal, the EER, resembling each others but
dissimilar to American articles. To do that, we used bibliographic
coupling techniques. In a bibliographic coupling network, a link is
created between two articles when they have one or more references in
common. The more references that two articles have in common, the
stronger the link. Bibliographic coupling is one way to measure how
similar two articles are in a corpus. To normalize and weight the link
between two articles, we used the refined bibliographic coupling
strength of Shen et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-shen2019}{2019}).\footnote{We have implemented
  this method in the \emph{biblionetwork} R package: Aurélien Goutsmedt,
  François Claveau and Alexandre Truc (2021). biblionetwork: A Package
  For Creating Different Types of Bibliometric Networks. R package
  version 0.0.0.9000.} This method normalized and weight the strength
between articles by taking into account two important elements

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The size of the bibliography of the two linked articles. It means that
  common references between two articles with long bibliography are
  weighted as less significant since the likeliness of potential common
  references is higher. Conversely, common references between two
  articles with a short bibliography is weighted as more significant.
\item
  The number of occurrences of each reference in the overall corpus.
  When a reference is shared between two articles, it is weighted as
  less significant if it is a very common reference across the entire
  corpus and very significant if it is scarcely cited. The assumption is
  that a very rare common reference points to a higher content
  similarity between two articles than a highly cited reference.
\end{enumerate}

For all macroeconomics articles published in the EER and in the Top 5,
we build the networks with 8-year overlapping windows. This results in
23.

We use Leiden detection algorithm
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-traag2019}{Traag et al., 2019}) that optimize
the modularity on each network to identify groups of articles that are
similar to each other and dissimilar to the rest of the network. We use
a resolution of 1 with 1000 iterations. This results in 466 clusters
across all networks. Because networks have a lot of overlaps, many
clusters between two periods are composed of the same articles. To
identify these clusters that are very similar between two time windows,
we considered that \emph{(i)} if at least 55\% of the articles in a
cluster of the first time window where in the same cluster in the second
time window, and that \emph{(ii)} if the cluster was also composed by at
least 55\% of articles of the first time window, \emph{then} it is the
same cluster. Simply put, if two clusters share a high number of
articles, and are both mostly composed by these shared articles, they
are considered the same cluster.

This gives us 154 clusters, with 33 that represent at least 4\% of a
network and are stable enough to exists for at least 2 time windows. We
are thus able to project the composition of each network and how nodes
circulated between clusters from one time window to the following one.

For each cluster, we identify the US or European oriented nature of its
publications and authors. A first measure we used is the over/under
representation of European/US authors in the cluster. For each time
window, we computed the \emph{(i)} share of articles written by European
authors and US authors in each cluster, and \emph{(ii)} the overall
share of European authors and US authors. Then, for each cluster, we
computed the \emph{(i)} mean share of European authors and US authors,
and \emph{(ii)} the overall mean share of European authors and US
authors, across all time windows in which the cluster exists. When then
compared these mean share using the log of ratios:

\bigskip

\({\scriptstyle \text{Author EU/US Orientation}=\log(\frac{(\frac{\text{Mean Share Of European Authored Articles In The Cluster}}{\text{Mean Share Of US Authored Articles In The Cluster}})} {(\frac{\text{Overall Mean Share Of European Authored Articles in Cluster's Time Window}}{\text{Overall Mean Share Of US Authored Articles in Cluster's Time Window}})})}\)
\bigskip

We then use a second similar index for the publication venue of the
articles in the cluster:

\bigskip

\({\scriptstyle \text{Journal EU/US Orientation}=\log(\frac{(\frac{\text{Mean Share Of EER Articles In The Cluster}}{\text{1-Mean Share Of EER Articles In The Cluster}})} {(\frac{\text{Overall Mean Share of EER Articles in Cluster's Time Window}}{\text{1-Overall Mean Share of EER Articles in Cluster's Time Window}})})}\)
\bigskip

Finally, clusters are placed on a scatterplot with the X-axis for the
\emph{Author EU/US Orientation} score, and the X-Axis for the
\emph{Journal EU/US Orientation} score. The size of the points captures
the number of articles in the cluster (see Figure
\ref{fig:plot-community-diff}).

Supplementary information about each cluster can be found in the online
appendix ``Bibliographic information about the EER and details on the
bibliographic coupling clusters''.

\hypertarget{alt-index}{%
\paragraph*{Alternative Indexes}\label{alt-index}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Alternative Indexes}

In addition to the main index, we propose a few alternative indexes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Mean of Log of Ratios Index} (see Figure
  \ref{fig:plot-mean-log-ratios}): this index computes a very similar
  log ratio as the main index, but the \emph{Author EU/US Orientation}
  and \emph{Journal EU/US Orientation} scores are computed on each
  individual window for each clusters, and the overall score of each
  cluster is the mean of the score across all time windows in which the
  cluster exists. However, one issue is that the score is not computed
  for time windows in which the clusters have 0 observations for some
  modalities.
\item
  \textbf{Chi2 Index} (see Figure \ref{fig:plot-chi-two-mean}): this
  index is very different from all other indexes. For each time window,
  we made a chi-square test of independence. We then used the adjusted
  standardized residuals computed for each time window to investigate
  the difference between expected and observed frequency for each
  modality of our variables. A positive residual indicates that the
  observed frequency is greater than what was expected, while a negative
  residual indicates that the observed frequency is less than what was
  expected. For each cluster, we then used the average residual across
  all time windows in which the cluster exists. For the \emph{Author
  EU/US Orientation} score with four modalities, the frequency of
  \emph{European Authored Articles} was used for the residual.

Our text corpus is composed of the titles and abstracts (when available)
of macroeconomics articles published in the Top 5 and EER. We have
several steps to clean our corpus before running our topic models:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Titles and abstracts are merged together for all EER and Top 5
  articles.
\item
  We use the \emph{tidytext} and \emph{tokenizers} R packages to
  `tokenise' the resulting texts (when there is no abstract, only the
  title is thus tokenise)?\footnote{See Silge J, Robinson D (2016).
    ``tidytext: Text Mining and Analysis Using Tidy Data Principles in
    R.'' \emph{JOSS}, \emph{1}(3) and Lincoln A. Mullen et al., ``Fast,
    Consistent Tokenization of Natural Language Text,'' Journal of Open
    Source Software 3, no.23 (2018): 655.} Tokenisation is the process
  of transforming human-readable text into machine readable objects.
  Here, the text is split in unique words (unigrams), bigrams (pair of
  words) and trigrams. In other words, to each article is now associated
  a list of unigrams, bigrams and trigrams, some appearing several times
  in the same title \emph{plus} abstract.
\item
  Stop words are removed using the \emph{Snowball}
  dictionary.\footnote{See
    \url{http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/english/stop.txt}.} We
  add to this dictionary some common verbs in abstract like
  ``demonstrate'', ``show'', ``explain''. Such verbs are likely to be
  randomly distributed in abstracts, and we want to limit the noise as
  much as possible.
\item
  We lemmatise the words using the \emph{textstem} package.\footnote{Rinker,
    T. W. (2018). textstem: Tools for stemming and lemmatizing text
    version 0.1.4. Buffalo, New York.} The lemmatisation is the process
  of grouping words together according to their ``lemma'' which depends
  on the context. For instance, different form of a verb are reduced to
  its infinitive form. The plural of nouns are reduced to the singular.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{choosing-the-number-of-topics}{%
\paragraph*{Choosing the number of
topics}\label{choosing-the-number-of-topics}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Choosing the number of topics}

We use the Correlated Topic Model (\protect\hyperlink{ref-blei2007}{Blei
and Lafferty, 2007}) method implemented in the \emph{STM} R
package.\footnote{Roberts ME, Stewart BM, Tingley D (2019). ``stm: An R
  Package for Structural Topic Models.'' \emph{Journal of Statistical
  Software}, \emph{91}(2), 1-40.}

From the list of words we have tokenised, cleaned and lemmatised, we
test different thresholds and choices by running different models:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  by exluding trigrams or not;
\item
  by removing the terms that are present in less than 0.6\% of the
  Corpus (20 articles), 0.8\% (27) and 1\% (34);
\item
  by removing articles with less than 8 words or with less than 12
  words.\footnote{Here, only articles with no abstract are impacted.}
\end{itemize}

Crossing all these criteria, we thus have 12 different possible
combinations. For each of these 12 different combinations, we have run
topic models for different number of topics from 20 to 110 with a gap of
5. The chosen model integrates trigrams, removes only terms that appear
in less than 0,6\% of the documents and keep all articles if they have
more than 8 words in their title \emph{plus} abstract. We choose to keep
the model with 50 topics.

We have chosen the criteria and the number of topics by comparing the
performance of the different models in terms of the FREX value
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bischof2012}{Bischof and Airoldi, 2012}). We
have tested alternative specification for preprocessing steps and
different number of topics when the performance regarding FREX values
was similar. It seems to us that 50 topics allows us to have a model
with easily understandable topics and an interesting level of ``zoom''.
Indeed, increasing the number of topics just splits some topics in two,
but did not lead to fundamentally different results.

For each cluster, we are able to plot the distribution of the years of
publications of article, depending on their \emph{gamma} value for the
corresponding topic (See the online appendix ``Details on the topics'').

topics}\label{studying-the-european-character-of-topics}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{paragraph}{Studying the European character of
topics}

In Figure \ref{fig:plot-topic-diff} in the text above, we are only
keeping, for each topic, articles with a \emph{gamma} value above 0.1.
We then calculate the log ratio of EER and Top 5 articles for each
topic:

For robustness, we have also tested another method. We do not filter the
\(\gamma\) values and keep all articles. For each topic, we calculate
the average \(\gamma\) for articles published in the EER and in the Top
5. We subtract the two means. We do the same for articles written by
European authors only and by US authors only. The two resulting
differences are plot in the following Figure
\ref{fig:plot-topic-diff-alternative}.
