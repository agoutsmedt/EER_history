The book surveys the main aspects of the unemployment problem. It integrates macroeconomics with a detailed micro-analysis of the labour market. It uses a model to explain the puzzling post-war history of OECD unemployment and shows how unemployment and inflation are affected by systems of wage bargaining and unemployment insurance. For each issue the chapters develop a relevant theory, followed by extensive empirical analysis.},
