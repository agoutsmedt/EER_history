This yields a compact treatment of standard theory, clarifies some errors and confusions, and produces some new departures. In particular, the book (i) gives unified treatments of comparative statics and welfare, (ii) sheds new light on the factor-price equalization issue, (iii) treats the modern specific-factor model in parallel with the usual Heckscher-Ohlin one, (iv) analyses the balance of payments in general equilibrium with flexible and fixed prices, (v) studies imperfect competition and intra-industry trade.},

In this paper, I address the case of Edmond Malinvaud, who began opposing the New Classical Economics from the early 1980s and did so throughout the following thirty years. This study shows that his opposition was radical, i.e., multi-dimensional and systematic, and owes to the methodology and the practice of macroeconometric modeling. In turn, this twofold result sheds light on the nature and the rationale of the Old Keynesians' opposition to the New Classical Economics from the 1970s onwards, which can be interpreted along the same lines.},

  abstract = {The structure of labour markets is increasingly perceived as a determinant of the macroeconomic performance of a country. This article focuses on one aspect of labour markets, the degree of centralization of wage setting. The main conclusion is that extremes work best. Either highly centralized systems with national bargaining (such as in Austria and the Nordic countries), or highly decentralized systems with wage setting at the level of individual firms (such as in Japan, Switzerland and the US) seem to perform well. The worst outcomes with respect to employment may well be found in systems with an intermediate degree of centralization (such as in Belgium and the Netherlands). This conclusion is reasonably well supported by the available empirical evidence. It is also logical. Indeed, large and all-encompassing trade unions naturally recognize their market power and take into account both the inflationary and unemployment effects of wage increases. Conversely, unions operating at the individual firm or plant level have very limited market power. In intermediate cases, unions can exert some market power but are led to ignore the macroeconomic implications of their actions. These conclusions challenge the conventional wisdom which asserts that the more 'corporatist' is an economy, the better is its economic performance.},

By showing how nominal wages respond to increased government spending and taxes and vice versa, the paper attempts to explain the simultaneous tendency of many Western economies toward persistent inflation and expansion of the public sector. In particular, the paper stresses the macroeconomic consequences of the interaction between endogenous utility-maximizing governments and labour unions, and shows how the response of the economy to changes in government and union behaviour depends on the preferences of both parties with respect to inflation, employment, real disposable wages, and government spending as well as on their view of the relative magnitude of the employment and price effects of such changes.},

These countries, which typically feature centralized wage setting, have also tended to experience high nominal wage increases. The overall outcome may be described as a `devaluation-wage spiral'. This paper applies two models of repeated games to analyze the strategic interaction between an exchange rate setting policy maker and a wage setting trade union. It is shown how a devaluation-wage spiral may result from a conflict of interest over the real wage. It is also shown how reputational forces may provide a way out of the devaluation-wage spiral.},

In high job security countries, wages tend to be lower and more sensitive to outside unemployment. Job security provisions alone cannot be blamed for the high unemployment in European countries.},

But, although these inflation surprises can have some benefits, they cannot arise systematically in equilibrium when people understand the policymaker's incentives and form their expectations accordingly. Because the policymaker has the power to create inflation shocks ex post, the equilibrium growth rates of money and prices turn out to be higher than otherwise. Therefore, enforced commitments (rules) for monetary behavior can improve matters. Given the repeated interaction between the policymaker and the private agents, it is possible that reputational forces can substitute for formal rules. Here, we develop an example of a reputational equilibrium where the outcomes turn out to be weighted averages of those from discretion and those from the ideal rule. In particular, the rates of inflation and monetary growth look more like those under discretion when the discount rate is high.},

  abstract = {A discretionary policymaker can create surprise inflation, which may reduce employment and raise government revenue. But when people understand the policymaker's objectives, these surprises cannot occur systematically. In equilibrium people form expectations rationally and the policymaker optimizes in each period, subject to the way that people form expectations. Then, we find that (1) the rates of monetary growth and inflation are excessive; (2) these rates depend on the slope of Phillips curve, the natural unemployment rate, and other variables that affect the benefits and costs from inflation; (3) the monetary authority behaves countercyclically; and (4) unemployment is independent of money policy. Outcomes improve if rules commit future policy choices in the appropriate manner. The value of these commitments--which amount to long-term contracts between the government and the private sector--underlies the argument for rules over discretion.},

The reason for this apparent paradox is that economic planning is not a game against nature but, rather, a game against rational economic agents. We conclude that there is no way control theory can be made applicable to economic planning when expectations are rational.},

We also argue that the Maastricht convergence requirements will almost certainly lead to a `Great Divide' in the European Union. We therefore conclude that less emphasis should be put on prior convergence conditions and more on strengthening the functioning of the future monetary institutions of the Union.},

On the one hand, it leads to more tax competition between the countries: this ``economic effect'' tends to lower tax rates in both countries. On the other hand, it alters voters' preferences and makes them elect a different government: this ``political effect'' offsets the increased tax competition, although not completely.},

The latter method gives more precise estimates, especially for short horizons, and allows statistical inference and hypothesis testing. Expected rates of devaluation have generally fallen during the period. Still, some devaluation expectations relative to the Deutsche mark remain in 1992, except for the Belgian/Luxembourg franc and the Netherlands guilder. Expected rates of devaluation have fluctuated more than interest rate differentials.},

Also, at the time these contracts are introduced, employment overshoots its long-run level. An econometric estimation of labor demand with a panel of large Spanish industrial firms validates several of the model's implications, in particular the increase in employment's cyclical response.},
