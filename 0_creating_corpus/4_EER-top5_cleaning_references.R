#' - We have id2 that split (wrongly) non-null Item. We want to keep the Item and do not care of these
#' id2;
#' - We have multiple non-null Item associated to one id2. We want to check if these unique
#' id2 are right in merging the Item. 
#' - We have id2 associated to null Item. We want to check if the id2 is secure or if it
#' risks to associate together different references. By removing doublons, we are leaving
#' only one occurence
